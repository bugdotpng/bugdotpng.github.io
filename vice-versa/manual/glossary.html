                <dt id="adjunct">Adjunct</dt>
                <dd>Anyone drawn into a Host’s Branch during Staging; a person is drawn into a Branch if they are in physical contact with the Host while a Branch is being Staged. If that person is also touching someone else, they have a chance to be brought in as well, though the chances are much slimmer. See more in <a href="#adjunct-role">The Role of Adjuncts</a>.</dd>

                <dt id="advent">Advent</dt>
                <dd>The birth of a Vice, officially classifying a Host as Active. Advents are categorized as either Sudden or Gradual.
                    <dl>
                        <dt>Sudden Advent</dt>
                        <dd>When the Vice’s birth is tied directly to a specific event and the manifestation of the Vice Body nearly immediately follows after. Sudden Advents typically result in a rogue Branch, though due to the Vice’s immaturity, Committing said Branch is often achieved unintentionally after the Vice retreats from lack of energy. Vices with Sudden Advents are not inherently easier to treat, though their Advent and the resulting Branch often give valuable insight into properties of the Vice’s Body that aid in successfully addressing future Branches and achieving Resolution.
                        </dd>
                        <dt>Gradual Advent</dt>
                        <dd>When the Vice’s creation slowly happens over time; no one event or emotion is tied to the Vice’s Body, making it more difficult to determine its properties. Vices with Gradual Advents are not inherently more complex, though they do have a higher chance of reaching maturity. Vices with a Gradual Advent are typically indicated by increased and uncharacteristic fatigue and are often accidentally detected via ultrasound or other medical imaging.

                <dt id="blight">Blight</dt>
                <dd>Blights are not a physical extension of a Vice; rather, Vices are closer to being extensions of a Host’s body, influenced by a Vice’s Exhibition and abilities. Blights can mirror a Vice’s Exhibition in varying degrees, depending on phase, maturity and severity. See more in <a href="#blights">What are Blights?</a>.

                <dt id="body">Body</dt>
                <dd>Considered to be the actual, physical embodiment of a Vice, if a Vice Body is destroyed, the Vice is Resolved. Not to be confused with its Exhibition, Vice Bodies typically reside inside the Host’s physical body much like a growth or tumor, but have been known to exist and thrive outside a Host in extreme circumstances. They have proven to be quite difficult to observe at a cellular level, often triggering threatening Branches when sharp instruments come near, though they can be detected and monitored via PI and VIM Scans, respectively. Vice Bodies are thought to influence Exhibitions (and therefore Blights) and hold the key to a successful Rescission. Learn more in <a href="#biology">Properties of Life</a>.

                <dt id="branch">Branch</dt>
                A Vice’s attempt at distracting a Host while it focuses on expanding its ionic tunnels, not to be confused with Rescission; during Branches, Vices will fabricate an environment in an attempt to disorient and confuse the Host, bringing in Adjuncts in what is often described as a "shared hallucination". If the Branch remains unaddressed and continues for too long, the Vice will begin spreading its Body through the ionic tunnels, resulting in a Berserk Host.

            <div class="description-block">
                <dt id="exhibition">Exhibition</dt>
                The visual manifestation of a Vice and the origin of Blights; Vices create Exhibitions as a means to inflict fear and distract the Host as a Branch progresses. Often influenced by its Body and Advent, a Vice’s Exhibition can also be as unique as its Host, and many Hosts with similar Vice Bodies have different Vice Exhibitions. Exhibitions can be observed in Branches, but more accurately in Rescissions. Most, if not all, Vices have a predominantly black Exhibition with one or two accent colors. Exhibitions typically lean more animalistic and less humanoid, though some Vices are bipedal. A Vice’s Exhibition typically adheres to the structure of a head, torso, appendages, and tail. Appendages can be either arms, legs, or wings, though some Vices have wings instead of arms, or have more of a snake-like lower body. Their skin can range from human-like, to scales, to feathers, to goopy, tacky, and tar-like. Their skin is also often known to have specific properties, such as high acidity or shocking capabilities. Be it known that Vice Exhibitions are incredibly unique, and often determined by a Host’s personal experiences or even fears. Exhibitions can only be observed by the Host and any Adjuncts present and do not exist outside of Branches.

                <dt id="host">Host</dt>
                A person with a Vice; deemed insensitive by some, it is a word more commonly found in research spaces, rather than everyday life. The relationship between a Host and their Vice is evident by this terminology and is often regarded as parasitic, though in less extreme cases, Hosts have been seen to live with their Vices their entire lives, managed with the help of Adjuncts and Suppressants. As stated before: Everyone possesses the ability to become a Host, but the probability fluctuates based on environment, personal characteristics, and past Vice-related encounters.

                <dt id="patch">Patch</dt>
                A physical manifestation of a Host’s body attempting to protect it; not all Hosts obtain Patches, and little is known about what parameters urge a Host’s body to do so. Patches range in appearance and function and often resemble weapons or defenses, crafted especially to counter the Host’s Vice. Many experts believe that the creation of a Patch is the body’s way of telling a Host that a Vice is changing or approaching a threatening status.

                <dt id="rescission">Rescission</dt>
                The act of a Host separating from their Vice, preventing the Body from fusing with the Host. Doing so is an extremely risky move, as the Vice often becomes erratic, unpredictable, and desperate, unable to survive separated from its Host for long; however, Rescission is necessary to Resolve a Vice and is deemed successful once a Vice’s Body is destroyed. Rescission can only be performed once, and either results in Resolution or Propagation. Learn more in <a href="#recission-guide">A Basic Guide to Recision</a>.

            <div class="description-block">
                <dt id="resolution">Resolution</dt>
                The end goal of most Hosts, achieved by a successful Rescission; Resolution only refers to Hosts that have completed a successful Rescission or have been able to progress through the Comatose phase. Vices that have been Resolved are still capable of reignition through future Advents, though the threat is low and has only been observed in severe cases. Lingering Blights are not uncommon, and can be dealt with on their own or with the help of Suppressants.
