        <h1>Vice Biology</h1>
        <p>When most think of a Vice, their Exhibition is what comes to mind. Though their Exhibition is what a Host would encounter in a Branch and see manifested through Blights, the only physical, tangible part of a Vice is their Core. Cores have been likened to both tumors and parasites, but many vicologists struggle to find a word that accurately portrays what a Vice truly is.</p>
        <p>Because Vices cannot exist separate from their Host&mdash;except in extreme cases&mdash;collecting samples and gathering high-level diagnostic data about these creatures has proven extremely difficult. What we do know about their biological makeup and behavior has been outlined below.</p>
        <h2>Properties of Life</h2>
        <p>Vices are considered to be "alive", according to the widely-understood properties of life, summarized below.</p>
<ul class="characteristics">
    <li><a href="#bio-order">Order</a>: Vice Cores are comprised of cells and are considered organic matter, often beginning as a benign growth embedded in the Host's flesh.</li>
    <li><strong>Response to Stimuli</strong>: Vices are extremely protective of their Cores and often (if not always) lash out when threatened, making sample collection difficult.</li>
    <li><strong>Reproduction</strong>: Vices are capable of reproduction in a process not dissimilar to molds and mushrooms that release spores.</li>
    <li><strong>Growth and Development</strong>: Vices have been observed to follow a life cycle, outlined below.</li>
    <li><strong>Homeostasis and Regulation</strong>: Vices are known to require specific conditions to thrive, and have even been observed performing thermoregulation or thickening the outer layer of their Cores.</li>
    <li><strong>Energy Processing</strong>: Vices are known to "feed" off a selection of hormones present in their Host's system and have been documented "preferring" certain hormones over others.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="bio-order">Vice Order</h3>
<p>The only part of a Vice that is considered physical is the Vice’s Core. While Branches can result in physical distress and Exhibitions can influence Blights, these are “side effects” of these phenomena, rather than direct extensions of them. Blights are not considered part of the biological makeup of Vices, and are more akin to sores or growths <em>caused</em> by the Core.</p>
<p>The actual biological composition of a Vice’s Core is unknown, though we are capable of detecting it via traditional medical imaging and by scanning for a particularly concentrated emission of positive ions at a specific point in a Host’s body, called a PI Scan, unique to the field of Vicology.</p>
<p>Many Vice Cores are first discovered accidentally, detected via ultrasounds or other medical imaging techniques. Vice Cores typically present as masses of soft tissue in ultrasounds, for example. It has become a common practice for medical professionals to issue subsequent PI scans after detecting unexpected masses in their patients.</p>
<p>The Vice Core is typically embedded deep in muscle fibers or fatty tissue and avoids vital organs or high-mobility areas like joints. Most common, low-threat Vices typically range from 10mm to 15mm in diameter, while more mature or high-threat Vices have measured up to 60mm. They aim to be as inconspicuous as possible to avoid any early detection, though it is uncommon that a Host is able to physically feel an embedded Vice Core prior to detection via PI Scan.</p>
<p>After a positive PI Scan, Hosts are encouraged to attend regular checkups to detect any progression or growth of the Vice Core. PI Scans merely detect and do not measure an increase in positive ions. Vice Ion Measurement (VIM) Scans combine traditional medical imaging techniques with the technology used to initially detect ions to measure the growth of a Vice Core, shown below. VIM Scans are typically much more expensive than PI Scans, and thus require an initial PI Scan to be approved for use. Read more about growth patterns in <a href="#bio-growth">Vice Growth</a>.</p>

<h3 id="bio-stimuli">Response to Stimuli</h3>
<div class="bio-columns">
    <div class="col">
<p>The most common way that Vices react to changes in their environment are via triggering Branches, their main line of defense. Vices have been observed reacting to changes in a Host's emotions, blood pressure, or hormones. Vice Cores can either detect them at the site where they are embedded in the Host or through a complex system of ionic tunnels that travel throughout a Host's body. High-traffic areas where tunnels converge have been known to appear on VIM Scans, though their detection ebbs and flows with the movement of ions. The more mature Vices have much denser ionic tunnels and are thus easier to detect via VIM Scans, though doing so provides no benefit to the Host or VMS. These ionic tunnels cannot be influenced by any human technology and serve to feed the Vice Core environmental feedback and warn the Vice of any impending threats by tapping into the Host’s parasympathetic nervous system and endocrine system. In addition to the emotions absorbed at the attachment site, the Vice can also subsist on the emotions gathered by the ionic tunnels, though they are typically much less potent.
</p>
<p>In rare and extreme cases, some Vices have “outgrown” their Host and were successful in planting themselves outside of the Host’s physical body. In many of these instances, the Core creates a smaller duplicate of itself to embed externally, where it sends extra energy it gathers in what many experts refer to as a "bunker". This external bunker is an extension of the Vice itself, tied to its Core via an extremely dense cord of ionic tunnels. These inflexible networks have a tendency to keep Hosts stationery, imposing an immense strain on the Host’s endocrine and nervous system if the Host insists on straying farther than the network allows. If the Host strays too far from the bunker, the network will detatch, rendering the bunker unusable. Within minutes, the bunker disintegrates in a small burst of positive ions, often causing acute power surges in the process. The process of creatiing bunkers is typically only observed in mature Eta Vices.

<h3 id="bio-reproduction">Reproduction</h3>

<h3 id="bio-regulation">Homeostasis and Regulation</h3>
<h3 id="bio-energy">Energy</h3>
<h3 id="bio-drive">Biological Drive</h3>
<p>Vices often have a drive similar to most living creatures on this earth: to survive and repopulate. Vice reproduction is believed to occur as a result of Propagation, the act of a Vice consuming its Host and scattering its energy into the ether. This may seem counter-productive to survival, but many experts believe these particles embed themselves into humans and are what aid in initiating Advents once conditions are favorable. Vices essentially use Humans as a means to gather enough energy for an efficient Propagation, though this is typically only the case for more mature Vices. Many less-threatening Vices aim to achieve this, though they never mature past the larval stage. Only the more aggressive, persistent, and complex Vices reach maturity.
</p>
<h3 id="sentience">Intelligence &amp; Sentience</h3>
<p>The large majority of Vices have levels of intelligence akin to predatory animals, such as snakes or wildcats. This level of intelligence varies between Vices, and is primarily affected by the Vice’s classification and maturity. The large majority of Vices merely strive to survive and repopulate. All Vices have the capacity to observe and learn, but only in rare instances have Vices been known to communicate with humans on a level both it and the Host can understand. This rare display of sentience and self-awareness is exclusive to the Eta subclass. Eta Vices have been known to not only observe and learn about the Host’s behavior, but fight back with psychological warfare, finding tactical advantages against the Host that often render them helpless and terrified and ultimately lead to Propagation. Eta Vices are known to observe and document all Adjuncts, though the Host is the one it focuses its attention on. The higher the level of intelligence, the more imperative an Experienced Adjunct or Vice Management Specialist becomes.
</p>
<h2 id="life-cycle">The Life Cycle of Vices</h2>
<p>Vices typically progress through three stages after Advent: Larval, Adolescent, and Mature. In the event of Propagation, an additional Corporeal stage can be briefly observed. Vices progress through these stages and reach maturity by feeding on any and all negative emotions from its Host, though they prefer and often gorge themselves on the negative emotion(s) specifically tied to their Advent. When a Vice feeds, the waste it excretes often exacerbates the emotion, creating an exponential growth in said emotion that results in reports of fatigue, headaches, dizziness and nausea.
</p>
<p>Not all Vices reach maturity, and while maturity is not necessarily indicative of threat level, more mature Vices tend to be more calculated and dangerous.</p>
<div class="life-cycle">
    <div class="stage">
<h3>Stage 0: Origin and Advent</h3>
<p>A Vice’s life begins at its Advent. Though a Vice does not exist before its Advent, a Host’s experiences can influence the characteristics determined in a Vice’s Advent, leading to the creation of a Vice’s Core and ultimately influencing its future Exhibition. In the event of a Sudden Advent, the Vice Core is immediately detectable by PI Scans and classifies the Host as Active. Conversely, with a Gradual Advent, a Vice’s Core more so “fades” into being, typically being more complex as it picks up multiple properties over time. Once the Vice becomes detectable via PI Scan, the Host is classified as Active.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="stage">
<h3>Stage 1: Larval</h3>
<p>Larval Vices spend the majority of their time storing energy and learning the ebbs and flows of hormones. Branches at this stage are unlikely, and any energy expended by the Vice is dedicated to forming its Exhibition. In this stage, some Hosts report cases of extreme fatigue or disorientation due to a Vice’s excessive, uncontrolled feeding and seek Rescission guided by a Vice Management Specialist. This excessive feeding is primarily observed in Zeta Vices. Please note that Rescission at any stage poses risks. The properties of Larval Vices have not been determined and cannot be prepared for, though the probability of an advanced Exhibition and complex Branches are unlikely. Rescind with a professional only.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stage">
<h3>Stage 2: Adolescent</h3>
<p>An adolescent Vice has solidified its Exhibition and will begin prompting the Host into Branches. Each Branch causes a Vice’s stored energy to be depleted, so repeated Branches in quick succession are unlikely in this stage. Particularly aggressive Vices typically do not stay in this stage for long and often feed on the frustration or fear from their Host, quickly aiding in their maturity. It is in this stage where they learn to balance between feeding and initiating Branches, and they begin observing and documenting their Host’s behavior. Adolescent Vices, while more aggressive than larval Vices, are still impulsive and inexperienced. A successful Rescission is fairly likely in this stage, if desired. If a Vice is particularly aggressive or deceptive, it is highly encouraged to incite Rescission in this stage before it matures further.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stage">
<h3>Stage 3: Mature</h3>
<p>Mature Vices not only have a solidified Exhibition, but have perfected their Branch formula and mastered the art of balancing Branches and feeding, maximizing their energy control. Mature Vices are much more calculated than Adolescent Vices, and while Branches are less common, they’re much more dangerous. Rescission in this stage is a must, though it is extremely risky. It is advised to enlist the help of Experienced Adjuncts as well as a Vice Management Specialist familiar with your case.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stage">
<h3>Fringe Stage 4: Corporeal</h3>
<p>In the event of an unaddressed Branch, a Vice will begin the process of fusing with its Host by spreading its tightly condensed Core along the ionic tunnels embedded throughout the Host. A Vice has successfully fused with its Host after its Core has completely saturated the ionic tunnels, rendering the Rescission unsuccessful. The Core seeps out of the ionic tunnels and consumes the Host from the inside out, gathering energy to initiate Propagation. Any attempts at destroying the Host prematurely at this stage will result in a weaker Propagation, though the window of opportunity is slim, as this consumption stage is often completed in a few minutes. Experts have been unsuccessful in discovering a way to fully destroy a Vice Core at this stage, regardless of how little it has consumed of its Host. If the Vice is able to fully consume its Host, it will be visible for a brief moment before Propagation. Reports claim that the Core resembles a hovering sphere so dark that light cannot escape. The Core is incredibly dense, packing all the extraneous energy absorbed by the Vice into a sphere no larger than a baseball. The initiation of Propagation is akin to a very brief shock wave that sends the absorbed energy back into the ether. The further these energy particles travel, the more they fade from our perception, eventually becoming undetectable. While no concrete evidence has been gathered, many experts believe these particles embed themselves in potential Hosts, waiting for favorable conditions to initiate an Advent and begin the cycle again.
