        <h1>What is CVRS?</h1>
        <p>CVRS is the Center for Vice Research and Support. Our goal is to mitigate Vice-related crises and continue expanding research in the field of Vicology. We provide Vice management services and support and are available 24/7.</p>
        <h2 id="cvrs-wards">Wards</h2>
        <p>Each CVRS station is separated into two distinct wards. The Passive Ward is open to the public and accepts walk-ins, but patients will need to be examined by the lead Vice Management Specialist before treatment can begin. The Active Ward&mdash;and more specifically, the Urgent Care team&mdash;also requires referal from a medical professional, including specialists from the Passive Ward.</p>

                <h4>Passive<div class="badges"><span class="badge passive">Passive</span></div></h4>
                <p>Primarily concerned with providing long-term care while aggregating data to send to the Research Sector and Active Ward.</p>
                <p>Each Passive Ward consists of at least one:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Intake Coordinator</li>
                    <li>Vice Management Specialist</li>

        <h3 id="cvrs-sectors">Sectors</h3>
        <p>CVRS is divided into three sectors: Public Safety, Public Health, and Research. Each sector is tasked with unique roles, but often collaborate with other sectors to aggregate or share data.</p>
        <p>Each Sector contains agents from both the Passive and Active wards to ensure an efficient and holistic approach to care and research. Urgent Care teams have representation from each Sector to ensure that the most thoughtful and informed actions can be taken to serve our community.</p>
        <div class="small">
        <p>Some agents from the Research Sector are deployed as <a href="#pseudo">Pseudo Adjuncts</a> with a role to simply observe and collect data. While they are technically considered part of the Urgent Care team, Pseudo Adjuncts are not trained to engage in Branches, nor is it biologically possible to do so.* <a href="#adjunct-role">Learn more in The Role of Adjuncts.</a></p>
        <p class="footnote">* As is understood by our current set of data, 2023.</p>

                    Deployed to active Branches to observe and aggregate data about Vices and their respective Branches; Vice Analysts focus on high-level, big-picture data and are often looking for both trends and anomalies, but are trained to Commit or Suspend Branches as a last resort. Many Vice Analysts go on to specialize in specific analyses, such as Branches, Vice behavior, Blights, and Dispersion. While not incredibly skilled in any specific area, Vice Analysts are the only agents in the Research Sector to be deployed as actively involved Adjuncts, rather than Pseudo Adjuncts.

                    Focuses predominantly on the science of Branches and the physiological effects of Branches on the mind and body of both Hosts and Adjuncts. Branch Analysts are often deployed with the Urgent Care team as a Pseudo Adjunct and very rarely aid in Commits.

                    A fairly niche field focused exclusively on Blight manifestation and the effects prolonged Blights can have on a Host's body; while many are focused on furthering research, Blight Analysts are also qualified to prescribe Suppressants and treatment plans under the guidance of a Vice Management Specialist.

                    An incredibly niche and understaffed field focused exclusively on the science of Dispersion, though they are often unable to assist in preventing Dispersion, as they are only involved as a Pseudo Adjunct; while uncommon, the presence of a Dispersion Analyst at a Branch is widely regarded as a death sentence. Only a handful of Hosts have managed a successful Resolution despite the presence of a Dispersion Analyst.

        <h3 id="cvrs-branch-training">Branch Training</h3>
        <p>Many CVRS agents are required to receive varying levels of Branch Training prior to their official start date. The level of training coincides with the agent's role.</p>

                </div>
                <p>Basic Training is mandatory for all CVRS agents and gives a high-level overview of Vice anatomy, physiology, and psychology. During this time, agents learn about the properties of Branches.</p>
                <p>The following roles are available as career options after Basic Training has been completed:</p>
                <ul>

                <p>Building on the knowledge acquired in Basic Training, agents learn how to stall Branches until help arrives. Agents must past a written exam in order to become certified.</p>
                <p>The following roles require Extension Training:</p>
                    <ul>

                </div>
                <p>Suspension Training is the first level of training where Agents learn from Active Hosts and are brought in as Pseudo Adjuncts for training purposes. The Agent must successfully Suspend a Branch in order to receive certification.</p>
                <p>The following roles require Suspension Training:</p>

                </div>
                <p>Rather than bringing in agents as Pseudo Adjuncts only, agents are often brought in to aid in live Branches, focusing on seeing a Commit through. Agents are trained to Suspend if Committing isn't an option. Agents receive certification after a successful Commit as the Primary Adjunct.</p>
                <p>The following roles require Commit Training:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><a href="#vice-analyst">Vice Analyst</a></li>

            </div>
            <p>Resolution Training is the most rigorous Branch Training and requires agents to routinely Commit Branches. Many agents with this degree of experience do not Suspend Branches unless a Commit would be threatening the safety of the Host or Adjuncts. An agent must successfully Resolve a Vice in order to become certified.</p>
            <p>The following roles require Resolution Training:</p>

    <h3 id="cvrs-eq">Equipment</h3>
          <p>Upon completion of training, agents are provided with an equipment kit to aid in their varying roles. Below is a list of equipment provided by CVRS, who they are given to, and what they are used for.</p>
