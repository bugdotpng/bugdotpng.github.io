        <h1>What are Blights?</h1>
        <p>Blights are extensions of a host's body, influenced by a Vice’s Exhibition and the properties of its Core. All Blights are visible to the human eye and can be further studied by <a href="#blight-analyst">Blight Analysts</a> and <a href="#vice-management-specialist">Vice Management Specialists</a>. When extracted from a Host, Blights are not dissimilar to the organic materials they are mimicking, such as scales or feathers. It is only when they are still attached to the Host that their unique properties can be observed.</p>
<p>For example, if a Vice's Exhibition is covered in scales and exudes electricity, the Host is likely to have a couple patches of scales on their arms or face and lightly shock others when touching. If the Host progresses to a more severe phase or the Vice is more mature, the Host might have their entire upper body covered in scales and have uncontrollable bouts of electric pulses.
</p>
<p>There are three categories of Blights:</p>
<dl>
    <div class="description-block">
        <dt>Expulsion Blights</dt>
        <dd>Expulsion Blights originate in, but ultimately leave, the body. Expulsion Blights typically begin around the Vice Core and exit the Host through the mouth, nose, ears, or pores. Examples of Expulsion Blights are smoke, static, and acid; most Hosts only have one or two Expulsion Blights, if any.
        </dd>
    </div>
    <div class="description-block">
        <dt>Drape Blights</dt>
        <dd>Drape Blights typically lay close to the skin, rarely straying from the Host’s body. Drape Blights begin, and often stay, in localized patches across the skin, but in severe cases or progressed phases, they have been known to cover a Host’s entire body. Drape Blights are fairly uncommon, though they have a tendency to manifest in groups and overlap with the other. Some Hosts have noted velvety scales or leathery patches lined with fur.
        </dd>
    </div>
    <div class="description-block">
        <dt>Extrusion Blights</dt>
        <dd>Extrusion Blights are extensions of a Host’s body, typically originating deep in tissues or bones, and tend to mirror a Vice’s Exhibition. These are the most common and have been known to occur in many different ways, Hosts often being inflicted with upwards of 5 Extrusion Blights at a time. The larger and further away from the body an Extrusion Blight is, the more sensitive or painful the base becomes due to strain. Extrusion Blights are often heavy, dense, and uncomfortable, and larger Blights often drive Hosts to seek treatment. Examples of smaller Extrusion Blights are fangs, blunt horns, and claws, while larger, more painful Extrusion Blights can be tails, long horns, wings, or spikes.</dd>

<h2>Treating and Managing Blights</h2>
<p>If a Host has particularly bothersome Blights, or they are a danger to themself or others, treatments and therapies are available through either as-needed use of Suppressants, or regular visits with a Vice Management Specialist.</p>
<p>Suppressants are much like pain-killers in that they block the signals to the brain, preventing the Blights from spawning. They do not actually address the source of the problem, and are thus easy to abuse if a Host is desperate for relief. Suppressants are not intended for long-term use, as repeated use can mask the severity of Blights and lead to rogue Branches that would otherwise be detectable. They are intended to be taken on an as-needed basis for short-term relief.</p>
<p>If long-term relief is desired, a Host can regularly meet with a Vice Management Specialist in what are essentially psychological therapy sessions, similar to those of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy. These CVRS agents help Hosts identify and avoid triggers and can provide guidance on navigating the complex emotions that often urge Blights to spawn.</p>
<h2>Aftermath</h2>
<p>In extreme cases, some Blights can have permanent effects on a Host's body, even after Resolution. While the lingering Blights pose no threat, they can be bothersome and even painful for Hosts, especially if they are the result of larger Extrusion Blights. A small Suppressant dose is often prescribed to use on an as-needed basis to offer relief during flare-ups. Vice Management Specialists can offer some treatment, though it is often less effective than when treating an Active Host.</p>
