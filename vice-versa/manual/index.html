        <p>Vicemortiferum [VEE-seh-mohr-TI-fehr-um] or more commonly known as Vices, are beings that manifest and draw their energy from strong negative emotions and the effects these emotions can have on our bodies. Not all instances of such emotions result in the birth of Vices, and not all Vices present themselves in a way that is observable. Vices, as a field of study, is still widely under-researched, due in large part to the unique nature of both Vices and their Hosts. This manual is the result of decades of passionate research, but despite our continued efforts, the true nature of Vices remains unknown. The exact circumstances that result in the birth of a Vice are still being studied, and the probability fluctuates based on environment, personal characteristics, and past Vice-related encounters.</p>
            </div>
        <p>Despite their unpredictable, varying and unique natures, experts have been able to observe behaviors, create classifications and formulate care plans, which will be covered in this manual. Future versions will be distributed as we learn more about the ever-evolving field of Vicology.</p>
        <p>Vices are considered parasitic in their natural form, providing no benefits to the Host in addition to feeding on the energy, hormones, and emotions of a Host. In dire cases, Vices have been known to protect their Host as a means of self-preservation.</p>
        <p>The Advent of a Vice, especially less aggressive classifications, is not necessarily a death sentence, as is widely misunderstood. In fact, there are many instances of Hosts living long, full lives with their Vices, and many Hosts with less severe Vice classifications are able to keep them under control on their own. Regardless, Hosts, especially those with more severe Vice classifications, are encouraged to enlist the help of an Adjunct(s) or Vice Management Specialist and establish a support system as early in the process as possible.</p>
        <p>Most Hosts are able to rid their body of their Vice through a process known as Rescission. The process of Rescission looks different between different classifications of Vices, but can generally be prepared for by observing a Vice’s behavior in more common situations known as Branches, where a Host can either Suspend or Commit said Branch.</p>
        <p>Vices are often categorized into specific classifications that can be used to predict behaviors, Commit Branches, or prepare for Rescissions. Professional classification is encouraged, as some Vices are difficult to observe and categorize. Along with a professional classification, many Hosts often seek out Suppressants or Vice Management Therapy. Suppressants are a class of drug specialized in suppressing the manifestation of Blights, which can range from mildly irritating to life-threatening. Suppressants can only be prescribed after a positive PI Scan performed by a Vice Management Specialist. Regular checkups are encouraged to track any potential Vice progression or deviation, which can be monitored with VIM Scans. Vice Management Therapy—most closely akin to Cognitive Behavioral Therapy—is often pursued if Suppressants fail to perform or if a Host continues to have adverse side effects after three weeks of regular use.</p>

                <dd>Anyone drawn into a Host’s Branch during Staging; a person is drawn into a Branch if they are in physical contact with the Host while a Branch is being Staged. If that person is also touching someone else, they have a chance to be brought in as well, though the chances are much slimmer. See more in <a href="#adjunct-role">The Role of Adjuncts</a>.</dd>

                <dt id="advent">Advent</dt>
                <dd>The birth of a Vice, officially classifying a Host as Active. Advents are categorized as either Sudden or Gradual.
                    <dl>
                        <dt>Sudden Advent</dt>
                        <dd>When the Vice’s birth is tied directly to a specific event and the manifestation of the Vice Body nearly immediately follows after. Sudden Advents typically result in a rogue Branch, though due to the Vice’s immaturity, Committing said Branch is often achieved unintentionally after the Vice retreats from lack of energy. Vices with Sudden Advents are not inherently easier to treat, though their Advent and the resulting Branch often give valuable insight into properties of the Vice’s Body that aid in successfully addressing future Branches and achieving Resolution.
                        </dd>
                        <dt>Gradual Advent</dt>
                        <dd>When the Vice’s creation slowly happens over time; no one event or emotion is tied to the Vice’s Body, making it more difficult to determine its properties. Vices with Gradual Advents are not inherently more complex, though they do have a higher chance of reaching maturity. Vices with a Gradual Advent are typically indicated by increased and uncharacteristic fatigue and are often accidentally detected via ultrasound or other medical imaging.

                <dd>Blights are not a physical extension of a Vice; rather, Vices are closer to being extensions of a Host’s body, influenced by a Vice’s Exhibition and abilities. Blights can mirror a Vice’s Exhibition in varying degrees, depending on phase, maturity and severity. See more in <a href="#blights">What are Blights?</a>.

                <dd>Considered to be the actual, physical embodiment of a Vice, if a Vice Body is destroyed, the Vice is Resolved. Not to be confused with its Exhibition, Vice Bodies typically reside inside the Host’s physical body much like a growth or tumor, but have been known to exist and thrive outside a Host in extreme circumstances. They have proven to be quite difficult to observe at a cellular level, often triggering threatening Branches when sharp instruments come near, though they can be detected and monitored via PI and VIM Scans, respectively. Vice Bodies are thought to influence Exhibitions (and therefore Blights) and hold the key to a successful Rescission. Learn more in <a href="#biology">Properties of Life</a>.

                A Vice’s attempt at distracting a Host while it focuses on expanding its ionic tunnels, not to be confused with Rescission; during Branches, Vices will fabricate an environment in an attempt to disorient and confuse the Host, bringing in Adjuncts in what is often described as a "shared hallucination". If the Branch remains unaddressed and continues for too long, the Vice will begin spreading its Body through the ionic tunnels, resulting in a Berserk Host.

                <dt id="exhibition">Exhibition</dt>
                The visual manifestation of a Vice and the origin of Blights; Vices create Exhibitions as a means to inflict fear and distract the Host as a Branch progresses. Often influenced by its Body and Advent, a Vice’s Exhibition can also be as unique as its Host, and many Hosts with similar Vice Bodies have different Vice Exhibitions. Exhibitions can be observed in Branches, but more accurately in Rescissions. Most, if not all, Vices have a predominantly black Exhibition with one or two accent colors. Exhibitions typically lean more animalistic and less humanoid, though some Vices are bipedal. A Vice’s Exhibition typically adheres to the structure of a head, torso, appendages, and tail. Appendages can be either arms, legs, or wings, though some Vices have wings instead of arms, or have more of a snake-like lower body. Their skin can range from human-like, to scales, to feathers, to goopy, tacky, and tar-like. Their skin is also often known to have specific properties, such as high acidity or shocking capabilities. Be it known that Vice Exhibitions are incredibly unique, and often determined by a Host’s personal experiences or even fears. Exhibitions can only be observed by the Host and any Adjuncts present and do not exist outside of Branches.

                A person with a Vice; deemed insensitive by some, it is a word more commonly found in research spaces, rather than everyday life. The relationship between a Host and their Vice is evident by this terminology and is often regarded as parasitic, though in less extreme cases, Hosts have been seen to live with their Vices their entire lives, managed with the help of Adjuncts and Suppressants. As stated before: Everyone possesses the ability to become a Host, but the probability fluctuates based on environment, personal characteristics, and past Vice-related encounters.

                A physical manifestation of a Host’s body attempting to protect it; not all Hosts obtain Patches, and little is known about what parameters urge a Host’s body to do so. Patches range in appearance and function and often resemble weapons or defenses, crafted especially to counter the Host’s Vice. Many experts believe that the creation of a Patch is the body’s way of telling a Host that a Vice is changing or approaching a threatening status.

                <dt id="rescission">Rescission</dt>
                The act of a Host separating from their Vice, preventing the Body from fusing with the Host. Doing so is an extremely risky move, as the Vice often becomes erratic, unpredictable, and desperate, unable to survive separated from its Host for long; however, Rescission is necessary to Resolve a Vice and is deemed successful once a Vice’s Body is destroyed. Rescission can only be performed once, and either results in Resolution or Propagation. Learn more in <a href="#recission-guide">A Basic Guide to Recision</a>.

                The end goal of most Hosts, achieved by a successful Rescission; Resolution only refers to Hosts that have completed a successful Rescission or have been able to progress through the Comatose phase. Vices that have been Resolved are still capable of reignition through future Advents, though the threat is low and has only been observed in severe cases. Lingering Blights are not uncommon, and can be dealt with on their own or with the help of Suppressants.

        <h2 id="cvrs">What is CVRS?</h2>
            <p>CVRS is the Center for Vice Research and Support. Our goal is to mitigate Vice-related crises and continue expanding research in the field of Vicology. We provide Vice management services and support and are available 24/7.</p>
            <h3 id="cvrs-wards">Wards</h3>
            <p>Each CVRS station is separated into two distinct wards. The Passive Ward is open to the public and accepts walk-ins, but patients will need to be examined by the lead Vice Management Specialist before treatment can begin. The Active Ward&mdash;and more specifically, the Urgent Care team&mdash;also requires referal from a medical professional, including specialists from the Passive Ward.</p>

                    <p>Rather than bringing in agents as Pseudo Adjuncts only, agents are often brought in to aid in live Branches, focusing on seeing a Commit through. Agents are trained to Suspend if Committing isn't an option. Agents receive certification after a successful Commit as the Primary Adjunct.</p>

        <p>After Advent, Hosts are categorized into phases that predominantly guide an Intake Coordinator or Urgent Care team in determining treatment.</p>

            <div class="description-block">

                <dd>Hosts are considered Active when their Vice has been detected via PI Scans. At this stage, Vices can be monitored via VIM Scans and observed through Blights or Branches. In this stage, the Vice Body is connected to the physical form of the Host, draining their energy. Now that the Vice is detectable, classification can occur based on the Vice’s behavior, seen primarily through Branches. Some Hosts find their Vice bearable and can self-manage, though treatment plans are offered at this phase for more well-researched Vices. Many Hosts do not initiate Rescission at this phase, though it is an option. A Host spends the majority of their Vice’s life cycle in the Active phase.</dd>

                <dt>Berserk</dt>
                <dd>Hosts in the Berserk phase are in danger of their Vice fusing with their physical form. The Vice has begun expanding its Body along the ionic tunnels stretched throughout the Host's body. The unpredictable reactions and emotions often present in this phase are the result of the body mounting an inflammatory response against the advancing Vice. Many Hosts in this phase experience agitated Blights, often thought to be a direct result of the body's inflammatory response. This phase is the result of an unaddressed Branch or the Advent of certain classifications, such as Lambda Vices. While it is possible to properly Commit the Branch and regress to the Active phase, the rate of success is generally lower while the Host is in the Berserk phase, and Rescission is highly recommended so as to prevent further progression. Committing the Branch is considered a temporary fix, while Rescission is the only way to fully Resolve the Vice. If the Branch goes unaddressed, a Host will progress to the Comatose phase as the Vice attempts to complete its fusion.</dd>

Doing so has stretched the Vice Body extremely thin, in an attempt to achieve Propagation; although, due to this vulnerable state, Resolution is still achievable. If a Host is able to destroy a Vice’s Body during this phase, the Vice will be properly Resolved, but if a Host is unsuccessful, the Vice will complete the fusion process and begin the process of Propagation.</dd>

<h2 id="adjunct-role">The Role of Adjuncts</h2>
<p>Adjuncts can fall into 1 of 3 categories: Primary, Secondary, and Tertiary. Tertiary Adjuncts are often unassuming strangers brought into Branches by a Vice to throw off the Host, raise stakes, and increase energy consumption if a Vice is aiming for Propagation. Secondary Adjuncts are the most common, and intentionally brought into Branches by the Host after identifying a Branch staging. Primary Adjuncts have Committed a Host’s multiple Branches and tend to understand a Host’s Vice better than a Tertiary or Secondary Adjunct. Primary Adjuncts are less common, but invaluable during Branches and Rescission, especially.</p>
<p>Many Hosts find Branches to be jarring and disorienting, and often struggle to properly address their Branches alone. Primary and Secondary Adjuncts can increase the success rates, typically by strengthening defenses, increasing firepower, or even serving as a distraction. The chart below demonstrates the approximate increased success rates of enlisting Secondary Adjuncts for Branches, as they are the most common Adjuncts available.

<p>Primary Adjuncts often affect the above percentages, and typically add a buff of 1.3, so if you have a Vice with a low threat level and 1 (one) Primary Adjunct, your chances of success increase by 54.6% instead of 42%. Likewise, if you have a Vice with a high threat level and 2 (two) Adjuncts (one Primary, the other Secondary), your chances of success increase by 22.86% instead of 18.66%.
</p>
<p>Because Rescission varies greatly between Hosts and Vices, it is more difficult to determine how effective Adjuncts will be beforehand. Though we’re unsure of the exact impact Adjuncts have on Rescission, many Rescissions have failed due to lack of Adjuncts, so it is always advised to air on the side of caution and enlist as many Primary and Secondary Adjuncts as possible.
</p>
<p>While it is understood that a Host cannot always control their Branches to occur in close proximity to trusted Adjuncts, more experienced Adjuncts can work their way into Branches they were not originally drawn into with practice and precision. Some CVRS agents are able to force their way into Branches with the help of a <a href="#eq-push-manager">Push Manager</a>. Branches often occur on a different timeline than a Host’s surroundings, so a person attempting to join a Branch needs to act quickly and efficiently.
</p>
<h3 id="pseudo">Pseudo Adjuncts</h3>
<p>While not common in everyday Branches, some Adjuncts can be brought in as a Pseudo Adjunct, where they are able to view Branches and collect data. This method is primarily practiced by the <a href="#research">Research Sector</a> of CVRS agents and is used to observe Branches and document Vice behavior.</p>
<p>Pseudo Adjuncts are not affected by Propagation and are immediately expelled once Propagation is complete and the Adjunct no longer has a physiological tie to the Host. The window for observation varies, but is often long enough for <a href="#dispersion-analyst">Dispersion Analysts</a> to document any Vice Behavior in its final moments.</p>
<h2 id="patches">Patches: How They Can Help</h2>
<p>Patches are densely-packed negative ions--often in the shape of traditional weapons--that can help Hosts and Adjuncts sucessfully address Branches. Open Patches outside of Branches interact with our physical bodies similar to wind or water, in that their direct contact does not harm us, but at concentrated speeds, can leave bruises or even pierce through skin. Within Branches, they can deal devastating damage, though this typically only manifests afterward as sore muscles and joints.</p>
<p>The origin of Patches is unknown, though many experts speculate that the manifestation of negative ions came from our body's immune response to the sudden increase in positive ions from the Vice Body.</p>
<p>Patches are first observed in a Host as a burst of negative ions, typically observed as thin beams of light quickly sparking from fingertips, shoulders, ears, or noses. This is thought to be the body's subconscious response to a particularly threatening Vice, though not all Hosts are able to manifest Patches when threatened. Over time, as a Host learns to subconsciously concetrate said bursts, the bursts of ions last longer and weapons or other useful obejcts begin to form. Being a subconscious process, Hosts typically cannot control what the end result will be, and are often advised to focus on ion concentration, rather than perfecting a specific form.</p>
<p>Patches are most commonly manifested in Branches as a means of protection, though particularly seasoned Hosts and Adjuncts have been known to call their Patches as a Branch is being Staged to use it as a means of Suspending the Branch.</p>
<p>When patches make contact with human skin outside of a Branch, a brief burst of negative ions emanate from the point of contact. Repeated use of Patches can lead to degredation over time if the Patch is not given time to recover. Patches do not lose concentration within the parameters of a Branch.</p>
<p>At high speeds, Patches outside of Branches threaten coming into contact with a Vice Body, either via piercing the skin with a slashing weapon or the burst of negative ions released from a blunt object. If executed properly, this forces the Vice to retreat, resulting in a Suspended Branch. CVRS does not recommend this approach, which is further explored in <a href="#branches">What to Expect in a Branch</a>.
<p>
<h2 id="blights">What are Blights?</h2>
<p>Blights are extensions of a host's body, influenced by a Vice’s Exhibition and the properties of its Body. All Blights are visible to the human eye and can be further studied by <a href="#blight-analyst">Blight Analysts</a> and <a href="#vice-management-specialist">Vice Management Specialists</a>. When extracted from a Host, Blights are not dissimilar to the organic materials they are mimicking, such as scales or feathers. It is only when they are still attached to the Host that their unique properties can be observed.</p>
<p>For example, if a Vice's Exhibition is covered in scales and exudes electricity, the Host is likely to have a couple patches of scales on their arms or face and lightly shock others when touching. If the Host progresses to a more severe phase or the Vice is more mature, the Host might have their entire upper body covered in scales and have uncontrollable bouts of electric pulses.
</p>
<h3>Categorizing Blights</h3>
<dl>
    <div class="description-block">
        <dt>Expulsion Blights</dt>
        <dd>Expulsion Blights originate in, but ultimately leave, the body. Expulsion Blights typically begin around the Vice Body and exit the Host through the mouth, nose, ears, or pores. Examples of Expulsion Blights are smoke, static, and acid; most Hosts only have one or two Expulsion Blights, if any.
        </dd>
    </div>
    <div class="description-block">
        <dt>Drape Blights</dt>
        <dd>Drape Blights typically lay close to the skin, rarely straying from the Host’s body. Drape Blights begin, and often stay, in localized patches across the skin, but in severe cases or progressed phases, they have been known to cover a Host’s entire body. Drape Blights are fairly uncommon, though they have a tendency to manifest in groups and overlap with the other. Some Hosts have noted velvety scales or leathery patches lined with fur.
        </dd>
    </div>
    <div class="description-block">
        <dt>Extrusion Blights</dt>
        <dd>Extrusion Blights are extensions of a Host’s body, typically originating deep in tissues or bones, and tend to mirror a Vice’s Exhibition. These are the most common and have been known to occur in many different ways, Hosts often being inflicted with upwards of 5 Extrusion Blights at a time. The larger and further away from the body an Extrusion Blight is, the more sensitive or painful the base becomes due to strain. Extrusion Blights are often heavy, dense, and uncomfortable, and larger Blights often drive Hosts to seek treatment. Examples of smaller Extrusion Blights are fangs, blunt horns, and claws, while larger, more painful Extrusion Blights can be tails, long horns, wings, or spikes.</dd>
    </div>
</dl>
<h3>Vice Management Specialists and Suppressants</h3>
<p>If a Host has particularly bothersome Blights, or they are a danger to themself or others, treatments and therapies are available through either as-needed use of Suppressants, or regular visits with a Vice Management Specialist.</p>
<p>Suppressants are much like pain-killers in that they block the signals to the brain, preventing the Blights from spawning. They do not actually address the source of the problem, and are thus easy to abuse if a Host is desperate for relief. Suppressants are not intended for long-term use, as repeated use can mask the severity of Blights and lead to rogue Branches that would otherwise be detectable. They are intended to be taken on an as-needed basis for short-term relief.</p>
<p>If long-term relief is desired, a Host can regularly meet with a Vice Management Specialist in what are essentially psychological therapy sessions, similar to those of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy. These CVRS agents help Hosts identify and avoid triggers and can provide guidance on navigating the complex emotions that often urge Blights to spawn.</p>
<h3>Aftermath</h3>
<p>In extreme cases, some Blights can have permanent effects on a Host's body, even after Resolution. While the lingering Blights pose no threat, they can be bothersome and even painful for Hosts, especially if they are the result of larger Extrusion Blights. A small Suppressant dose is often prescribed to use on an as-needed basis to offer relief during flare-ups. Vice Management Specialists can offer some treatment, though it is often less effective than when treating an Active Host.</p> 
<h2 id="biology">Properties of Life</h2>
<p>Vices are, by all accounts, considered to be "alive", according to the widely-understood properties of life, outlined below.</p>
<ul class="characteristics">
    <li><a href="#bio-order">Order</a>: Vice bodies are comprised of cells and are considered organic matter. How many and what sort of cells, we are unsure, as any attempts to obtain a biopsy result in triggering a Branch.</li>
    <li><strong>Response to Stimuli</strong>: As mentioned above, Vices are extremely protective of their Bodies and often (if not always) lash out when threatened.</li>
    <li><strong>Reproduction</strong>: Vices are capable of reproduction in a process not dissimilar to molds and mushrooms that release spores.</li>
    <li><strong>Growth and Development</strong>: Vices have been observed to follow a life cycle, outlined below.</li>
    <li><strong>Homeostasis and Regulation</strong>: Vices are known to require specific conditions to thrive, and have even been observed performing thermoregulation or thickening the outer layer of their Bodies.</li>
    <li><strong>Energy Processing</strong>: Different Vices prefer different hormones and, but most Vices are known to "feed" off a selection of hormones present in their Host's system.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="bio-order">Vice Order</h3>
<p>The only part of a Vice that is considered physical is the Vice’s Body. While Branches can result in physical distress and Vice Exhibitions can influence Blights, these are “side effects” of these phenomena, rather than direct extensions of them. Blights are not considered part of the biological makeup of Vices, and are more akin to sores or growths <em>caused</em> by the Vice Body.</p>
<p>The actual biological composition of a Vice’s Body is unknown, though we are capable of detecting it via ultrasounds and by scanning for a particularly concentrated emission of positive ions at a specific point in a Host’s Body, called a PI Scan, unique to the field of Vicology.</p>
<p>Many Vice Bodies are first discovered accidentally, detected via ultrasounds or other medical imaging techniques. Vice Bodies typically present as masses of soft tissue in ultraasounds, for example. It has become a common practice for medical professionals to issue subsequent PI scans after detecting unexpected masses in their patients.</p>
<p>The Vice Body is typically embedded deep in muscle fibers or fatty tissue and avoids vital organs or high-mobility areas like joints. Most common, low-threat Vices typically range from 10mm to 15mm in diameter, while more mature or high-threat Vices have measured up to 60mm. They aim to be as inconspicuous as possible to avoid any early detection, though it is uncommon that a Host is able to physically feel an embedded Vice Body prior to detection via PI Scan.</p>
<p>After a positive PI Scan, Hosts are encouraged to attend regular checkups to detect any progression or growth of the Vice Body. PI Scans merely detect and do not measure an increase in positive ions. Vice Ion Measurement (VIM) Scans combine traditional medical imaging techniques with the technology used to initially detect ions to measure the growth of a Vice Body, shown below. VIM Scans are typically much more expensive than PI Scans, and thus require an initial PI Scan to be approved for use. Read more about growth patterns in <a href="#bio-growth">Vice Growth</a>.

    <img src="./images/body.jpg">
    <figcaption>A VIM Scan of a Vice Body. Its ionic tunnels are somewhat visible, indicating maturity.</figcaption>
    </figure>
<p>While the Vice Body is physically embedded in the Host, it is understood to be connected to the rest of the Host’s body through a complex system of ionic tunnels. High-traffic areas where tunnels converge have been known to appear on VIM Scans, though their detection ebbs and flows with the movement of ions. The more mature Vices have much denser ionic tunnels and are thus easier to detect via VIM Scans, though doing so provides no benefit to the Host or VMS. These ionic tunnels cannot be influenced by any human technology and serve to feed the Vice Body environmental feedback and warn the Vice of any impending threats by tapping into the Host’s parasympathetic nervous system and endocrine system. In addition to the emotions absorbed at the attachment site, the Vice can also subsist on the emotions gathered by the ionic tunnels, though they are typically much less potent.
</p>
<p>In rare and extreme cases, some Vices have “outgrown” their Host and were successful in planting themselves outside of the Host’s physical body. The Vice is still tied to the Host via the ionic tunnels and has adapted to feed on nearby emotions in an emergency, but it ultimately subsists on the Host’s emotions gathered by the extremely dense ionic tunnels. These incredibly dense and inflexible networks have a tendency to keep Hosts stationery, imposing an immense strain on the Host’s endocrine and nervous system if the Host insists on straying farther than the network allows. If the Host strays too far from the Vice Body, it will quickly retreat back to the Host, leaving parts of its Body behind so as to not send the Host into shock once it reattaches. This phenomena is typically only observed in mature Eta Vices.

<h3 id="bio-regulation">Homeostasis and Regulation</h3>
<h3 id="bio-energy">Energy</h3>
<h3 id="bio-drive">Biological Drive</h3>
<p>Vices often have a drive similar to most living creatures on this earth: to survive and repopulate. Vice reproduction is believed to occur as a result of Propagation, the act of a Vice consuming its Host and scattering its energy into the ether. This may seem counter-productive to survival, but many experts believe these particles embed themselves into humans and are what aid in initiating Advents once conditions are favorable. Vices essentially use Humans as a means to gather enough energy for an efficient Propagation, though this is typically only the case for more mature Vices. Many less-threatening Vices aim to achieve this, though they never mature past the larval stage. Only the more aggressive, persistent, and complex Vices reach maturity.
</p>
<h3 id="sentience">Intelligence &amp; Sentience</h3>
<p>The large majority of Vices have levels of intelligence akin to predatory animals, such as snakes or wildcats. This level of intelligence varies between Vices, and is primarily affected by the Vice’s classification and maturity. The large majority of Vices merely strive to survive and repopulate. All Vices have the capacity to observe and learn, but only in rare instances have Vices been known to communicate with humans on a level both it and the Host can understand. This rare display of sentience and self-awareness is exclusive to the Eta subclass. Eta Vices have been known to not only observe and learn about the Host’s behavior, but fight back with psychological warfare, finding tactical advantages against the Host that often render them helpless and terrified and ultimately lead to Propagation. Eta Vices are known to observe and document all Adjuncts, though the Host is the one it focuses its attention on. The higher the level of intelligence, the more imperative an Experienced Adjunct or Vice Management Specialist becomes.
</p>
<h2 id="life-cycle">The Life Cycle of Vices</h2>
<p>Vices typically progress through three stages after Advent: Larval, Adolescent, and Mature. In the event of Propagation, an additional Corporeal stage can be briefly observed. Vices progress through these stages and reach maturity by feeding on any and all negative emotions from its Host, though they prefer and often gorge themselves on the negative emotion(s) specifically tied to their Advent. When a Vice feeds, the waste it excretes often exacerbates the emotion, creating an exponential growth in said emotion that results in reports of fatigue, headaches, dizziness and nausea.
</p>
<p>Not all Vices reach maturity, and while maturity is not necessarily indicative of threat level, more mature Vices tend to be more calculated and dangerous.</p>
<div class="life-cycle">
    <div class="stage">
<h3>Stage 0: Origin and Advent</h3>
<p>A Vice’s life begins at its Advent. Though a Vice does not exist before its Advent, a Host’s experiences can influence the characteristics determined in a Vice’s Advent, leading to the creation of a Vice’s Body and even influencing its future Exhibition. In the event of a Sudden Advent, the Vice Body is immediately detectable by PI Scans and classifies the Host as Active. Conversely, with a Gradual Advent, a Vice’s Body more so “fades” into being, typically being more complex as it picks up multiple properties over time. Once the Vice becomes detectable via PI Scan, the Host is classified as Active.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="stage">
<h3>Stage 1: Larval</h3>
<p>Larval Vices spend the majority of their time conserving energy and scoping out any particularly appetizing emotions in the event of their preferred emotion’s scarcity. Branches at this stage are unlikely, and any energy expended by the Vice is dedicated to forming its Exhibition. In this stage, some Hosts report cases of extreme fatigue or disorientation due to the Vice’s excessive feeding and seek Rescission guided by a Vice Management Specialist. Please note that Rescission at any stage poses risks. The properties of Larval Vices have not been determined and cannot be prepared for, though the probability of an advanced Exhibition and complex Branches are unlikely. Rescind with a professional only.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stage">
<h3>Stage 2: Adolescent</h3>
<p>An adolescent Vice has solidified its Exhibition and will begin prompting the Host into Branches. Each Branch causes a Vice’s stored energy to be depleted, so repeated Branches in quick succession are unlikely in this stage. Particularly aggressive Vices typically do not stay in this stage for long and often feed on the frustration or fear from their Host, quickly aiding in their maturity. It is in this stage where they learn to balance between feeding and initiating Branches, and they begin observing and documenting their Host’s behavior. Adolescent Vices, while more aggressive than larval Vices, are still impulsive and inexperienced. A successful Rescission is fairly likely in this stage, if desired. If a Vice is particularly aggressive or deceptive, it is highly encouraged to incite Rescission in this stage before it matures further.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stage">
<h3>Stage 3: Mature</h3>
<p>Mature Vices not only have a solidified Exhibition, but have perfected their Branch formula and mastered the art of balancing Branches and feeding, maximizing their energy control. Mature Vices are much more calculated than Adolescent Vices, and while Branches are less common, they’re much more dangerous. Rescission in this stage is a must, though it is extremely risky. It is advised to enlist the help of Experienced Adjuncts as well as a Vice Management Specialist familiar with your case.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stage">
<h3>Fringe Stage 4: Corporeal</h3>
<p>In the event of an unaddressed Branch, a Vice will begin the process of fusing with its Host by spreading its tightly condensed Body along the ionic tunnels embedded throughout the Host. A Vice has successfully fused with its Host after its Body has completely saturated the ionic tunnels, rendering the Rescission unsuccessful. The Body seeps out of the ionic tunnels and consumes the Host from the inside out, gathering energy to initiate Propagation. Any attempts at destroying the Host prematurely at this stage will result in a weaker Propagation, though the window of opportunity is slim, as this consumption stage is often completed in a few minutes. Experts have been unsuccessful in discovering a way to fully destroy a Vice Body at this stage, regardless of how little it has consumed of its Host. If the Vice is able to fully consume its Host, it will be visible for a brief moment before Propagation. Reports claim that the Body resembles a hovering sphere so dark that light cannot escape. The Body is incredibly dense, packing all the extraneous energy absorbed by the Vice into a sphere no larger than a baseball. The initiation of Propagation is akin to a very brief shock wave that sends the absorbed energy back into the ether. The further these energy particles travel, the more they fade from our perception, eventually becoming undetectable. While no concrete evidence has been gathered, many experts believe these particles embed themselves in potential Hosts, waiting for favorable conditions to initiate an Advent and begin the cycle again.

            <dd>Alpha Vices are the most common and easiest to treat due to their predictability. This classification refers to a wide umbrella of Vices that all share the same standard formula of a Sudden Advent, non-threatening Blights, and regular, predictable Branches. Alpha Vices are capable of progressing to the Berserk stage-often due to intense Bodies-but are also known to hover in the Active stage for the majority of a Host’s life.

They are slightly more complicated because of said deviations, but they are still generally easy to treat with the correct preparation.

Delta Bodies are known to change and shift over time or can change in response to external stimuli. With each shift, the Vice’s threat is lowered, so Hosts typically stay in the Active phase, though there have been cases that progressed to the Berserk phase. Their cycling often results in exhaustion and frustration, driving Hosts to seek treatment via Rescission.

Epsilon Bodies are known to change their Blights or Branch formulae on a whim to avoid accurate treatment and ultimately deter Rescission. If agitated or threatened, Epsilon Vices can progress a Host to the Berserk stage, where they often present their true Body and Exhibition. Because the Host is often unprepared, Epsilon Vices are more likely to result in a Comatose Host&mdash;and even Propagation&mdash;compared to other, less threatening classifications.

Similar to Epsilon Vices, Lambda Vices are extremely likely to result in a Comatose Host because they are often unprepared. Though, if successful, Lambda Vices get easier to treat over time with the proper care and attention and can deteriorate into something barely detectable. After the initial rogue Branch is successfully Committed, their intensity threshold is lowered, and Hosts cycle between Latent and Active phases with occasional, easily addressable Branches. Over time, the Vice diminishes enough to keep the Host in a Dormant phase, similar in characteristics to the Latent phase. Lambda Vices are the only classification that cannot be Resolved. The threat for reignition is high, though many Hosts are able to avoid it due to the knowledge acquired from successfully Committing Branches.

However, unlike Lambda Vices, Xi Vices eventually plateau at a specific point and begin revving back up in severity over time.

While its Advent may be intimidating and off-putting, it is ultimately harmless and quite easy to address. Its structural integrity is so poor that it can be Resolved without inciting a Rescission (through successfully Committing a Branch, for example), or it will deteriorate on its own. Despite their dysfunction, Hosts with Phi Vices should stay vigilant, as the chances of reigniting with a different classification of Vice are fairly high. The presence of a Phi Vice confirms that the Host has the necessary conditions to harbor Vices. 50% of Hosts with Phi Vices have another Advent that results in a new classification of Vice. 15% reignite with another Phi Vice, raising their 50% chance of reignition to 75%.

    <h4>Further Classification</h4>
    <p>In certain cases, further classification may be applied to provide a more complete understanding of a Host’s Vice. Many of these subclasses are applied after extensive observation and interaction, and in extreme cases, can be the difference between life and death. While Vices can manifest in a multitude of ways, the subclasses below are merely observed groups of similar behaviors and characteristics among varying Vice classes and are the result of experts’ limited knowledge. It is highly likely subclasses outside of these exist.</p>
    <p>Subclasses are denoted with a leading double-hyphen and do not include threat levels. Refer to the primary classification to assess any threats.</p>

        <div class="description-block">
            <dt id="gamma">&ndash;&ndash;Gamma</dt>
            <dd>This subclass refers to any Vices with three sets of a specific body part in its Exhibition (3 heads, 3 tails, or 6 arms, for example). Vices with this subclass often work to obscure two of the three sets in order to throw off Hosts and Adjuncts. A Gamma Vice never stores their Body anywhere in the duplicated parts, which easily regenerate unless the Body itself is addressed.

        </div> 
        <div class="description-block">
            <dt id="kappa">&ndash;&ndash;Kappa</dt>
            <dd>A rather uncommon subclass that refers to Vices that are “contagious”, meaning they can transfer between Hosts. This is uncommon, since Vices come from and thrive off the very specific conditions provided by their Host, and transferring Hosts puts the Vice at risk of transferring to an inhospitable environment. If this is the case, the Vice’s Body deteriorates and the Vice is considered Resolved. Though uncommon, this is typically only observed when a particularly mature Vice feels threatened, and a Host with seemingly identical conditions are within range. The Kappa subclass is only applied once the Vice has transferred Hosts, the original Host being considered Cleared. For the new Host, this transaction is often classified as a Sudden Advent, beginning the cycle anew. Learn more about the process of transferring Vices in Vice Reproduction.

            <dd>An extremely rare subclass that is often applied post-Propagation, as Vices with this subclass seem to exhibit sentience and are, therefore, incredibly deadly and nearly impossible to Resolve without the proper resources. The only observed instances of this subclass have been with Omega Vices, so much so that many experts believe this subclass should be removed and sentience be added to the Omega classification.

Vices with the Tau or Antitau subclass can be Resolved through the normal procedures determined by its primary classification, but these Vices are also capable of being Resolved by inciting a Branch with another Host who has a Vice that is the exact, physiological opposite of the other Host’s. The Tau subclass is applied to the Vice that initially incites the Branch, and the Vice on the defensive receives the Antitau subclass. The result of their clashing is a powerful exchange&mdash;progressing both Hosts from Active > Berserk > Cleared in a matter of minutes&mdash;that leaves both Hosts with their Vices Resolved. This is an extremely exhausting process that often leaves both Hosts unresponsive for days at a time.

<h2 id="branches">What to Expect in a Branch</h2>
<p>A Branch can be Committed alone or with the help of Adjuncts or a Vice Management Specialist. Vices often use people, phrases, smells, and anything that could possibly resemble the properties of their Advent to incite Branches. Branches typically happen in the Active phase, and if they go unaddressed, can push a Host into the Berserk phase. Branches are fairly common for Hosts, but are a Vice’s way of attempting to distract their Host so they can begin the act of fusing with them, resulting in a Berserk Host, which may ultimately lead to a Comatose Host, or in extreme cases, Propagation. Commit any Branches immediately.</p>
<p>A Host is presented with three options when experiencing a Branch: Suspend, Commit, or Rescind. An easy way to remember the difference between Suspending and Committing a Branch is that Suspending typically takes place outside of a Branch, and Committing typically takes place after a Branch has been initiated. There is still some overlap, however, as the beginnings of Branches vary between Vices, and some cases of Suspending can happen in the early stages of a Branch. Understanding your Vice and observing its behavior is crucial to being able to differentiate between the two if the situation ever arises. Suspending a Branch generally has negative connotations as it can raise the likelihood of future Branches, often increasing their severity. This typically happens prior to or in the early stages of a Branch, when the Vice has barely emerged from its Body, and often leaves the Host and Adjuncts without any new information, doing no more than agitating the Vice. Branches should only be Suspended in dire circumstances, such as Adjuncts being inaccessible or the Host being unprepared. Committing a Branch generally has more positive associations, as Hosts and Adjuncts typically leave with a better understanding of the Vice, potentially having witnessed its Exhibition and behaviors and having depleted much of the Vice’s energy reserve. Most Hosts and Adjuncts default to Committing Vices, as is encouraged by most professionals, unless prepared for a Rescission. Committing Branches typically lessens the probability of new Branches in the near future.</p>
<p>Committing and Suspending Branches are achieved by rendering the Host as an “inhospitable environment”, this status being determined by the Vice. If the Branch has been initiated, more extreme measures can be taken so as to assure a properly addressed Branch. Hosts will likely not feel any physical repercussions after an aggressively addressed Branch outside of stiff muscles or mild headaches, though some experts believe that the body does indeed remember. Suspending Branches typically poses a higher risk of the Host sustaining physical injuries.</p>
<h3>Branch Properties</h3>
<p>In the early stages of researching Vices, it was debated whether or not a Branch was a tangible, physical incident or an elaborate mind game played on the Host. Now, we understand that a Branch is somewhere in between, and something that can even affect Adjuncts. Branches are “real” in the way that dreams and thoughts are real. Physically tangible, no, but Branches are still dangerous and can have physical, mental, and emotional effects on a Host and their Adjuncts. What happens in a Branch is not a direct one-to-one correlation to the outside world, as many injuries sustained in the process of Committing or Suspending Branches typically do not carry over, or at least not to the same degree of severity. More severe injuries sustained during an Committed Branch have been seen to manifest as stiff joints or muscle aches, and typically last anywhere from a day to a handful of weeks. Injuries sustained during a Suspended Branch have a higher likelihood of carrying over without the lessened severity. If you are still experiencing pain or discomfort from a Branch after a month, Acute Suppressants might be able to help.</p>
<p>Branches do not occur on the same time scale that we experience, and Branches that feel like they last for hours can be a mere handful of seconds in the real world. The most notable indication of an impending Branch is the feeling of being pulled toward the Host, and can last anywhere from a split second to a couple minutes. If a person is in contact with the Host while this sensation occurs, they will be pulled in as an Adjunct. After the pulling sensation subsides, the window for being pulled in has closed, though experienced Adjuncts can work their way in with practice, often at the expense of time passing drastically in the Branch.</p>
<p>More mature Vices are capable of expelling Adjuncts from Branches, though it is an extremely risky move, as doing so significantly drains the Vice of energy. Vices only expel Adjuncts they see as a severe risk. Adjuncts are technically capable of re-entering Branches after this has occurred, though it is extremely rare and incredibly difficult.</p>
<p>Branches are influenced largely in part by the characteristics and properties of a Vice’s Advent. In an attempt to disorient or emotionally paralyze Hosts, Vices often fabricate scenes, smells, and sounds strikingly similar to emotionally-charged life events, including but not limited to the Vice’s Advent. Branches can range from simple scenes to complex environments, their complexity often influenced by a Vice’s maturity. These environments have often been described as similar to dreams, their structures and layouts making sense during the Branch, but being incomprehensible afterward. Vices often interweave bits and pieces from different real-life happenings, maximizing emotional impact during the Branch and leading to feelings of confusion and exhaustion afterward. While the base formula for a Branch stays the same throughout a Vice’s life cycle, the more a Vice matures, the more it is capable of building on that base formula and introducing new scenes and properties. Noting the nature of these changes and additions can help prepare for future Rescission.</p>
