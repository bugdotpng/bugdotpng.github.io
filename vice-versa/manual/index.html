        <p>Vicemortiferum [VEE-seh-mohr-TI-fehr-um] or more commonly known as Vices, are beings that manifest and draw their energy from strong negative emotions. Not all instances of such emotions result in the birth of Vices, and not all Vices present themselves in a way that is observable. Vices, as a field of study, is still widely under-researched, due in large part to the unique nature of both Vices and their Hosts. This manual is the result of decades of passionate research, but despite our continued efforts, the true nature of Vices remains unknown. The exact circumstances that result in the birth of a Vice are still being studied, and the probability fluctuates based on environment, personal characteristics, and past Vice-related encounters.</p>
            </div>
        <p>Despite their unpredictable, varying and unique natures, experts have been able to observe behaviors, create classifications and formulate care plans, which will be covered in this manual. Future versions will be distributed as we learn more about the ever-evolving field of Vicology.</p>
        <p>Vices are considered parasitic in their natural form, providing no benefits to the Host in addition to feeding on the energy and emotions of a Host. In dire cases, Vices have been known to protect their Host as a means of self-preservation.</p>
        <p>The Advent of a Vice, especially less aggressive classifications, is not necessarily a death sentence, as is widely believed. In fact, there are many instances of Hosts living long, full lives with their Vices, and many Hosts with less severe Vice classifications are able to keep them under control on their own. Regardless, Hosts, especially those with more severe Vice classifications, are encouraged to enlist the help of an Adjunct(s) or Vice Management Specialist and establish a support system as early in the process as possible.</p>
        <p>Most Hosts are able to rid their body of their Vice through a process called Rescission. The process of Rescission looks different between different classifications of Vices, but can generally be prepared for by observing a Vice’s behavior in more common situations known as Branches, where a Host can either Suspend or Commit said Branch.
        Vices are often categorized into specific classifications that can be used to predict behaviors, Commit Branches, or prepare for Rescissions. Professional classification is encouraged, as some Vices are difficult to observe and categorize. Along with a professional classification, many Hosts often seek out Suppressants or Vice Management Therapy. Suppressants are a class of drug specialized in suppressing the manifestation of Blights, which can range from mildly irritating to life-threatening. Suppressants can only be prescribed after a positive PI Scan performed by a Vice Management Specialist. Regular checkups are encouraged to track any potential Vice progression or deviation, which can be monitored with VPG Scans. Vice Management Therapy—most closely akin to Cognitive Behavioral Therapy—is often pursued if Suppressants fail to perform or if a Host continues to have adverse side effects after three weeks of regular use.</p>

                <dd>The birth of a Vice, officially classifying a Host as Active. Advents can be categorized as either Sudden or Gradual.

                        <dt>Sudden Advent</dt>
                        <dd>When the Vice’s birth is tied directly to a specific event and the manifestation of the Vice nearly immediately follows after. Sudden Advents typically result in a rogue Branch, though due to the Vice’s immaturity, Committing said Branch is often achieved unintentionally. Vices with Sudden Advents are not inherently easier to handle, though their Advent and the resulting Branch often give valuable insight into properties of the Vice’s Body that aid in successfully addressing future Branches and achieving Resolution.
                        </dd>
                        <dt>Gradual Advent</dt>
                        <dd>When the Vice’s creation slowly happens over time; no one event or emotion is tied to the Vice’s Body, making it more difficult to determine its properties. Vices with Gradual Advents are not inherently more complex, though they do have a higher chance of reaching maturity. Vices with a Gradual Advent are typically indicated by increased and uncharacteristic fatigue, prompting a Host to seek out a PI Scan if other physiological factors are ruled out.

                <dd>Blights are not a physical extension of a Vice; rather, Vices are closer to being extensions of a Host’s body, influenced by a Vice’s Exhibition and abilities. Blights can mirror a Vice’s Exhibition in varying degrees, depending on phase, maturity and severity. See more in What are Blights.

                <dd>The only known physical aspect of a Vice, this is the single most important part of a Vice’s makeup. The actual biological composition of a Vice Body is unknown, though it is understood to be largely influenced by the properties of its Advent, particularly the negative emotions present. Vice Bodies can be detected and monitored via PI and VPG Scans, respectively. Not to be confused with its Exhibition, Vice Bodies give valuable insight to a Vice’s properties, can influence Exhibitions (and therefore Blights), and hold the key to a successful Rescission. Vice Bodies can originate from a single emotion (common in the case of Sudden Advents) or multiple emotions (seen in Gradual Advents) and do not seem to adhere to any specific set of parameters. If a Vice’s Body is destroyed, the Vice is considered Resolved. Vices are extremely protective of their Body and often go out of their way to protect it during combat. Observing and understanding this behavior can aid in Resolution. Vice Bodies typically reside inside the Host’s physical body as a biological object akin to a growth or tumor, but have been known to exist and thrive outside a Host in extreme circumstances, covered in The Biology and Life Cycle of Vices.

                A Vice’s attempt at distracting a Host while it focuses on expanding its ionic tunnels, not to be confused with Rescission; during Branches, Vices will fabricate an environment in an attempt to disorient and confuse the Host. If the Branch remains unaddressed, the Vice will begin spreading its Body through the ionic tunnels, resulting in a Berserk Host. See more in What to Expect in a Branch.

                The visual manifestation of a Vice, and the origin of Blights; often influenced by its Body, a Vice’s Exhibition can also be as unique as its Host, and many Hosts with similar Vice Bodies have different Vice Exhibitions. Exhibitions can be observed in Branches, but more accurately in Rescissions. Most, if not all, Vices have a predominantly black Exhibition with one or two accent colors. Exhibitions typically lean more animalistic and less humanoid, though some Vices are bipedal. A Vice’s Exhibition typically adheres to the structure of a head, torso, appendages, and tail. Appendages can be either arms, legs, or wings, though some Vices have wings instead of arms, or have more of a snake-like lower body. Vices often have varying temperatures, some ice cold and others searingly hot, typically influenced by their Body. Their skin can range from human-like, to scales, to feathers, to goopy, tacky, and tar-like. Their skin is also often known to have specific properties, such as high acidity or shocking capabilities. Be it known that Vice Exhibitions are incredibly unique, and often determined by a Host’s personal experiences or even fears. Exhibitions can only be observed by the Host and any Adjuncts present and do not exist outside of Branches.

                A person with a Vice; deemed insensitive by some, it is a word more commonly found in research spaces, rather than everyday life. The relationship between a Host and their Vice is evident by this terminology and is often regarded as parasitic, though in less extreme cases, Hosts have been seen to live with their Vices their entire lives, managed with the help of Adjuncts and Suppressants. As stated before: Everyone possesses the ability to become a Host, but the probability fluctuates based on environment, personal characteristics, and past Vice-related encounters.

                The act of a Host separating from their Vice, preventing the Body from fusing with the Host. Doing so is an extremely risky move, as the Vice often becomes erratic, unpredictable, and desperate, unable to survive separated from its Host for long; however, Rescission is necessary to Resolve a Vice and is deemed successful once a Vice’s Body is destroyed. Rescission can only be performed once, and either results in Resolution or Propagation. Learn more in Rescinding a Vice.

                The end goal of most Hosts, achieved by a successful Rescission; Resolution only refers to Hosts that have completed a successful Rescission or have been able to progress through the Comatose phase. Vices that have been Resolved are still capable of reignition through future Advents, though the threat is low and has only been observed in severe cases. Lingering Blights are not uncommon, and can be dealt with on their own or with the help of Suppressants.

                A physical manifestation of a Host’s body attempting to protect it; not all Hosts obtain Supports, and little is known about what parameters urge a Host’s body to do so. Supports range in appearance and function and often resemble weapons or defenses, crafted especially to counter the Host’s Vice. Many experts believe that the creation of a Support is the body’s way of telling a Host that a Vice is changing or approaching a threatening status.

                <dt>Active</dt>
                <dd>Hosts are considered Active when their Vice is detectable via PI Scans and can be perceived through either Blights or Branches, though this phase does not inherently mean a Host is in danger. In this stage, the Vice is latched onto the physical form of the Host, draining their energy through feeding on emotions. Now that the Vice is detectable, diagnosis and classification can occur based on the Vice’s behavior, seen primarily through Branches. Some Hosts find their Vice bearable and can self-manage, though treatment plans are offered at this phase for more well-researched Vices. Many Hosts do not initiate Rescission at this phase, though it is an option. A Host spends the majority of their Vice’s life cycle in the Active phase.</dd>

            <div class="description-block">
                <dt>Berserk</dt>
                <dd>Hosts in the Berserk phase are in danger of their Vice fusing with their physical form. The unpredictable reactions and emotions often present in this phase are the result of the body attempting to mount an inflammatory response against the advancing Vice. This phase is the result of an unaddressed Branch or the Advent of certain classifications, such as Lambda Vices. While it is possible to properly Commit the Branch and regress to the Active phase, the rate of success is generally lower while the Host is in the Berserk phase, and Rescission is highly recommended so as to prevent further progression. Committing the inflammatory Branch is considered a temporary fix, while Rescission is the only way to fully Resolve the Vice. If the Branch goes unaddressed and Rescission is not initiated, a Host will progress to the Comatose phase as the Vice completes its fusion.</dd>

                <dt>Comatose</dt>
                <dd>This phase is the result of a Vice having fused over 75% of its Body with the Host. Doing so has drawn the Host incredibly close to its Body in an attempt to achieve Propagation; although, due to the extreme proximity to the Vice’s Body, Resolution is still achievable. If a Host is able to destroy a Vice’s Body during this phase, the Vice will be properly Resolved, but if a Host is unsuccessful, the Vice will complete the fusion process and begin the process of Propagation.</dd>

            <div class="description-block">
                <dt>Cleared</dt>
                <dd>A Cleared Host is the result of a successful Rescission, which is only achieved once the Vice Body is destroyed. In more extreme cases, trace amounts of a Vice’s ionic tunnels can still be detectable after Resolution and can contribute to lingering Blights, though these are not considered “live” fragments of the original Vice Body and pose no threat for reignition.</dd>

This classification refers to a wide umbrella of Vices that all share the same standard formula of a Sudden Advent, non-threatening Blights, and regular, predictable Branches. Alpha Vices are capable of progressing to the Berserk stage-often due to intense Bodies-but are also known to hover in the Active stage for the majority of a Host’s life.

Delta Bodies are known to change and shift over time or can change in response to external stimuli. With each shift, the Vice’s threat is lowered, so Hosts typically stay in the Active phase, though there have been cases that progressed to the Berserk phase. Their cycling often results in exhaustion and frustration, driving Hosts to seek treatment via forced Rescission.

                <dd>Also quite uncommon, Epsilon Vices are much harder to treat because of their deceptive nature. Epsilon Bodies are known to change their Blights or Branch formulae on a whim to avoid accurate treatment and ultimately deter Rescission. If agitated or threatened, Epsilon Vices can progress to the Berserk stage, where they often present their true Body and Exhibition. Because the Host is often unprepared, Epsilon Vices are more likely to progress to the Comatose phase than other, less threatening classifications.

                <dt id="theta">Theta <span class="threat med">Medium</span></dt>
                <dd>Theta Vices are the most chaotic of the Vices and deviate from any psychological norms experts have observed. While many Vices have a drive to survive, Theta Vices thrive on chaos and aim to consume as many victims as possible, often taking itself down in the process. Their greed ultimately leads to their demise, often drawing in more Adjuncts than it can handle. While unpredictable and often frustrating to prepare for, Theta Vices are quite brittle and can be easily Resolved via Rescission.

                <dt id="lambda">Lambda <span class="threat high">High</span></dt>
                <dd>Lambda Vices are quite rare and start out overwhelming and unmanageable, jumping from the Latent to the Berserk phase without warning and launching the Host into a Rescission. Similar to Epsilon Vices, Lambda Vices are extremely likely to progress to the Comatose phase because Hosts are unprepared. Though, if successful, Lambda Vices get easier to treat over time with the proper care and attention and can deteriorate into something barely detectable. After a successful Rescission, their intensity threshold is lowered, cycling between Latent and Active phases–with occasional, easily addressable Branches–and they eventually diminish to stay in the Latent phase. Lambda Vices are the only classification that do not result in a Resolved phase after a successful Rescission.

                <dt id="xi">Xi <span class="threat med">Medium</span></dt>
                <dd>Xi Vices have an aggressive Sudden Advent that gradually begins to diminish over time. However, unlike Lambda Vices, Xi Vices eventually plateau at a specific point and begin revving back up in severity over time. While Xi Vices do not pose quite as strong of a threat as Lambda Vices, they are often incorrectly classified, which leaves the Host unprepared for when the Vice inevitably increases in severity again. Paying close attention to the properties of the Advent will help ensure a proper classification.

                <dt id="phi">Phi <span class="threat low">Low</span></dt>
                <dd>A bizarre classification of Vice that is so chaotic and dysfunctional that it deteriorates shortly after its Sudden Advent. While its Advent may be intimidating and off-putting, it is ultimately harmless and quite easy to address. Its structural integrity is so poor that it can be Resolved without inciting a Rescission, or it will deteriorate on its own. Despite their dysfunction, Hosts with Phi Vices should stay vigilant, as the chances of reigniting with a different classification of Vice are fairly high. The presence of a Phi Vice confirms that the Host has the necessary conditions to harbor Vices. 50% of Hosts with Phi Vices have another Advent that results in a new classification of Vice. 15% reignite with another Phi Vice, raising their 50% chance of reignition to 75%.

                <dd>Extremely rare and often regarded as fatal, not much can be said about Omega Vices as a whole. This classification is often applied post-Propagation, as the properties of Omega Vices tend to shift in ways that other classifications do not, making classification particularly difficult. The Omega classification is reserved for Vices that cannot be categorized by any of the classifications outlined above, essentially acting as a fringe category of Vices with no shared characteristics other than their intensity and threat level. While Rescission is typically encouraged, Hosts with Omega Vices typically do not have enough information to initiate one successfully. Do not engage.
