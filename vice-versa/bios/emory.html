              <p>Vast pool of acquaintances, but limited close friends. Known to be very social and outgoing, but most relationships stay fairly shallow. Extremely close to sister (Adelaide, 19), but less close with mother. Not on speaking terms with father. Unsure of whereabouts.</p>
              <p>Close friends include childhood friends Rami (met in elementary school) and Genesis (met in middle school), with Daniel recently added to friend group (met in high school, but recently befriended). Single; somewhat promiscuous sex life.</p>

              <p>Small, but stable Adjunct core. Has a habit of initiating Branches while alone and far from Adjuncts, but the Primary Adjunct is reliable and can act quickly.</p>

              <h2>Vice History</h2>  
              <h3>Advent <span>Sudden</span></h3>
              <p>Host claims inciting incident was a heated argument with their father, wherein they felt the safety of their sister was threatened.</p>
              <p>Sister was pulled in as a Tertiary Adjunct, but Host claims their Branch subsided before anything happened. Another Branch initiated the following week, and after the Host was able to Suspend their Branch, they self-admitted to the Central Texas CVRS Unit due to lingering Blights.</p>
              <h3>Intake <span>09/13/2008</span></h3>
              <p>Host was given a classification of Alpha upon Intake and prescribed Supressants for lingering Blights.</li>
              <h3>Treatment</h3>
              <p>After their intake, the Host was able to stave off a Branch for roughly a month, wherein they were readmitted and the Branch was properly Committed. Any subsequent Branches were predictable, and the Host was provided a Branch checklist, alongside the guidance of procuring a primary Adjunct.</p>
