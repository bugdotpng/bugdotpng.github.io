        <h1><span class="superhead">1.0.0</span>The Branch</h1>
        <p>It was a calm Tuesday evening at the corner store, and Danny&rsquo;s shift had been relatively uneventful, much to his blood pressure&rsquo;s delight. As boring as it was, he knew to be careful what he wished for. The last time he had yearned for a little excitement, the street was full of uniformed officers in blacked-out vans, so he resigned himself to the monotony and returned to his phone to pass the time.</p>

<p>He was slumped over the checkout counter, staring past his phone as his thumb mindlessly sifted through a stagnant social media feed. There was a stale familiarity to his stance, and he realized he had spent the better half of the last three months in that exact spot, wearing the same uniform, scrolling the same feeds. Everything was starting to blur together into a haze of deja vu, and it was making him restless.</p>

<p>Typically, he preferred to distribute his hours between a handful of jobs&mdash;namely a waiter, pharmacy technician, and corner store cashier&mdash;to keep things &ldquo;interesting&rdquo;. After a surge in &ldquo;more promising applicants&rdquo;, the pharmacy laid him off, and his monthly income was cutting it close. His calls into the restaurant weren&rsquo;t consistent enough to guarantee a regular paycheck, but the corner store manager, Lawrence, was thankfully more than happy to sign off on more shifts.</p>

<p>It helped that Lawrence seemed to have a soft spot for Danny, so the extra shifts were not only allowed, but encouraged. Lawrence wasn&rsquo;t able to keep people employed if the store depended on it&mdash;which it definitely did&mdash;but it wasn&rsquo;t from a lack of trying. Sure, the general turnover rate for convenience store employees was fairly high, but it wasn&rsquo;t like people were leaving for better opportunities. The store seemed to be having an incredibly persistent string of bad luck, or so Lawrence claimed.</p>

<p>New hires were turning in their two weeks&rsquo; notice shortly after their start date, and even dependable employees were signing up for fewer and fewer shifts. There seemed to be a theme tying everyone together: sudden, debilitating illnesses. Even a handful of supply vendors canceled their contracts with the store because every time a driver was sent to deliver an order, they&rsquo;d have to call out for weeks due to an aggressive stomach bug or flu-like symptoms.</p>

<p>There definitely seemed to be a pattern, but Lawrence merely chalked it up to the cyclical nature of the universe. Whatever it was&mdash;bad luck, the supernatural, an aggressive stomach virus festering in the grout of the breakroom tile&mdash;he was convinced they just had to power through until it tired itself out, whatever the force was. And Lawrence was convinced it <em>was</em> a force, considering the numerous bleach treatments didn&rsquo;t seem to help.</p>

<p>Danny wasn&rsquo;t all too keen on Lawrence anthropomorphizing the force in question&mdash;it gave him the heebie jeebies in a way he couldn&rsquo;t quite articulate&mdash;but he continued signing up for shifts anyway. Bad luck or not, rent still needed to be paid, and he had worked at places before that had given him much more intense heebie jeebies and stomach viruses, so this was nothing. Plus, Danny&rsquo;s perpetual state of being was exhausted and a little nauseous, so if he had contracted whatever was going around, he couldn&rsquo;t tell.</p>

<p>Generally speaking, Danny was fairly superstitious and easily spooked, but the only thing he found spooky about the corner store was that <em>something</em> was making a pungent, funky smell and he had no idea what it was. He didn&rsquo;t really care to find out, either, so he nestled his nose under the collar of his polo and slumped further across the counter to continue perusing social media.</p>

<p>The bell above the front door chimed meekly as a customer stepped across the threshold. He gave them a polite nod as they tucked their head down and ambled to the back of the store. Incredible, thrilling, gripping! It was the most action he had seen in over half an hour. He pushed his phone away and turned his attention to the live security footage of the customer browsing the array of drinks.</p>

<p>They meandered past each display, intently studying the contents behind the glass doors. They couldn&rsquo;t seem to make up their mind, aimlessly sauntering up and down the aisle with no sign of preference, their gait slowing as time ticked by. Danny&rsquo;s shoulders fell in impatient disappointment. The customer had come to a complete stop in the middle of the aisle, still no drinks in hand.</p>

<p>Suddenly, the bell rang frantically as the front door flew open, making Danny&rsquo;s shoulders jolt in surprise. A flash of deep, fiery red locks blew past the threshold and a petite, gremlin-like character in a long olive jacket approached Danny at the counter.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, look who it is!&rdquo; they exclaimed incredulously, pushing their orange-tinted goggles up their forehead to reveal bright, lively brown eyes. &ldquo;What are the odds you&rsquo;re at one of my sites again?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Danny muttered an acknowledging &ldquo;Emory,&rdquo; with a nod, then picked up his phone to desperately refresh his feeds with a long drawn-out sigh. He figured that was what he deserved for secretly wishing for a bit of action. Emory was certainly the epitome of action, a whirlwind of unbridled chaos and obscenity. He looked up from his phone with raised brows. &ldquo;Did the wretched vibes summon you again?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Simply speaking, yes, but I don&rsquo;t like your tone,&rdquo; they sniffed indignantly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dunno where the hell you think they&rsquo;re coming from. It&rsquo;s not exactly <em>busy</em> tonight.&rdquo; He looked up and gestured to the near-empty store.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Just because <em>you&rsquo;re</em> not busy doesn&rsquo;t mean something&rsquo;s not happening around here. This is a big building. Could be the pawn shop next door or one of the apartments upstairs. Including yours. Don&rsquo;t you find it a little odd I got called here again?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Called? By who? The <em>vibes</em>?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Gh&ndash;<em>yes</em>, the vibes, jackass. But imma need you to wipe that smirk off your face before I do it for ya&rsquo;,&rdquo; they snarled.</p>

<p>Danny failed to wipe said smirk off his face. &ldquo;You could get in a lot of trouble, you know. You&rsquo;re lucky I haven&rsquo;t reported you yet.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, like you of all people give a damn. What would you even report me for?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Impersonating a CVRS Target Hunter.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They blew a dismissive raspberry and rolled their eyes. &ldquo;Seems a bit overkill, in my humble opinion. It&rsquo;s not like I&rsquo;m running around with a fake badge or anything.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Rami&rsquo;s told you he could get you a job with CVRS. I don&rsquo;t understand why you don&rsquo;t just do the bootcamp and get certified. You&rsquo;d get paid <em>much</em> better than the wimpy stipends they give out for civilian intervention.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not about the money,&rdquo; they turned their head with an irritated sniff.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well good, because it&rsquo;s not like CVRS pays a ton anyways. Regardless, Rami&rsquo;s told you to cut it out. It&rsquo;d be a shame if he found out you were still running around doing all this. You wouldn&rsquo;t want him to be disappointed in you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Emory&rsquo;s face fell into a scowl. &ldquo;How dare you make me even think of such a thing. And what, are you gonna tell on me? Thought you didn&rsquo;t care about this stuff. What good does tattling do for you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;d cut down on your impromptu visits, that&rsquo;s for sure.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re not <em>impromptu</em>. There&rsquo;s an art to this; I&rsquo;ve told you a million times. Regardless, this is the fourth call to this site in the last three months. Something&rsquo;s definitely up. It&rsquo;s not like I&rsquo;m hanging around here because of your stellar personality.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Four times, huh? How come I&rsquo;ve only seen you twice?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Two of &lsquo;em started swingin&rsquo; before I even got to the door. You didn&rsquo;t see me throwin&rsquo; hands in the middle of the street two weeks ago? Whole CVRS team showed up!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Danny returned to his phone with an unamused sniff. &ldquo;Could you hurry up and do your thing? I&rsquo;m done talking about this.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Y&rsquo;know, the longer I talk to you, the more I wonder if the bad vibes <em>are</em> coming from you,&rdquo; Emory huffed as they picked through their deep jacket pockets.</p>

<p>His shoulders slumped with a lightly offended grunt. &ldquo;What makes you think you&rsquo;re even in the right place?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Like I&rsquo;ve always said, kinda got a sixth sense for these things. Believe me or don&rsquo;t, but something&rsquo;s definitely off here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He returned to his phone with an amused scoff. &ldquo;Well, you&rsquo;re about 3 months late with that revelation. Lawrence and I have been talking about things being off for months now. He started putting salt in the door a few weeks ago. He&rsquo;s convinced it&rsquo;s a string of bad luck.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good try, Lawrence, but that ain&rsquo;t gonna do shit.&rdquo; They pulled out a pair of tattered fingerless gloves. &ldquo;Might ward off the low-level ghost I saw at the door, but that&rsquo;s not what this is.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hah-hah,&rdquo; he forced a laugh, then straightened into a stretch to inconspicuously check the front door.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not even bad luck, either,&rdquo; Emory continued. &ldquo;Anything else come to mind?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He rolled his eyes with a click of his teeth.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hey, you can&rsquo;t deny that three initiated Branches in three months is a little suspicious. Four if this call doesn&rsquo;t end up being a dud.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Danny eyed the frayed, unfinished edges of their gloves. They were likely a decade old at this point. &ldquo;Still can&rsquo;t believe you&rsquo;re running around doing this without a license.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;License-schmicense. Didn&rsquo;t realize you were such a CVRS bootlicker. Who gives a shit,&rdquo; they grumbled as they struggled to tear off a fraying thread. &ldquo;Is it just you and Lawrence working again tonight? I think I might do a lap and see&ndash;&rdquo; They suddenly paused, straightening in surprise. &ldquo;Oh shit, wait. Do you smell that?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Gotta be more specific. Lotta smells going on here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;...I think&hellip;vinegar?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Huh. I don&rsquo;t even know if we have&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Emory held up a quieting finger and continued in a hushed tone, &ldquo;You really don&rsquo;t smell that?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Surprised by their seriousness, Danny took a sniff to humor them. &ldquo;I guess it&mdash;&rdquo; He stumbled forward and caught himself on the counter.</p>

<p>Emory excitedly slammed their palms on the counter, a spark igniting in their eyes. &ldquo;Oh! Did you feel something? Is it a Branch?&rdquo; A gentle tug at the heels of their combat boots verified their assumption and they pounded their fists together with fiery conviction. &ldquo;Oh, <em>hell </em>yeah. I knew I was in the right place!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;E-Emory, seriously?&rdquo; he stammered, trying to ignore the magnetic pull pressing him against the counter. He looked past them to meet the eyes of the customer at the back of the store, their head limply thrown over their shoulder and their eyes trembling with fear. &ldquo;A-are you sure you should be doing this?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m <em>so</em> sure.&rdquo; Emory jauntily spun on their heel and locked eyes with the Host, flashing an exhilarated grin.</p>

<p>The Host&rsquo;s chest hitched erratically as they mouthed an inaudible plea, the sound of liquid gurgling in their throat. Danny swallowed dryly, unable to pull his eyes away.</p>

<p>Emory flipped a tuft of hair behind their shoulder and confidently looked back at Danny. &ldquo;Five minutes. Time me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They drove their heel into the tile, and a bright flash of light pulsed from their bandaged knee, shooting a beam into the air above them. It expanded and morphed into a massive, steel baseball bat in a burst of bright cyan. They gripped the worn rubber handle with a confidence born from repeated practice and bolted down the aisle with an unwavering conviction that Danny almost envied. Almost.</p>

<p>He tried to ignore the tightening lump in his throat, but the magnetic pull of a Branch initiation was one that rivaled the morbid fascination of watching a train wreck. It was almost impossible to look away, no matter how disgusted he was. The last thing he wanted to see was Emory&rsquo;s Suspension tactics in action, but he was forced to watch as the Host braced for their attack.</p>

<p>Emory lunged toward them, their hands gripping the handle of the bat thrown over their shoulder. His jaw clenched shut as the scuffed steel of the barrel smashed against the Host&rsquo;s cheek with a nauseating thud. They stumbled back, clattering against the glass doors as they uttered a protesting groan. Emory drove their knee into their stomach, and a wet, miserable cough made Danny&rsquo;s stomach churn as a clear goop sputtered from their lips.</p>

<p>A couple more home-run-worthy swings were all it took for the Host to fall to the ground in a shallow puddle of the translucent liquid oozing from their slack lips and unresponsive eyes. Emory raised a victorious fist, pumping their bat into the air before it warped out of sight in a bright flash of sparkling cyan. &ldquo;Danny! How long was that?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He cautiously emerged from behind the counter with his shoulders hunched in timid reluctance. &ldquo;I-I don&rsquo;t know. I wasn&rsquo;t timing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Gah, I told you to time me! I&rsquo;m getting really good at these!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Clearly,&rdquo; he muttered as he approached the person lying unconscious in a puddle of what appeared to be a subtly yellow-tinted, acidic-leaning goo. &ldquo;The magical bat seems a tad overkill. Do you really even need it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Listen, I earned this Patch. It&rsquo;s only fair that I use it for its intended purpose. Plus, most of &lsquo;em don&rsquo;t put up much of a fight when I whip that bad boy out. Don&rsquo;t wanna risk things getting outta hand, so I like to play it safe.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was getting hard to ignore the overwhelming odor assaulting his nostrils. The scene reeked of vinegar as the fluid seemed to dissipate into thin air, the pungent fumes warping the drink shelves behind them. Danny pulled his collar up over his nose. &ldquo;Sure we should be inhaling this stuff?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, it ain&rsquo;t gonna hurtchya. I don&rsquo;t think. Not any more than huffing bleach would, if I had to guess.&rdquo; They planted their hands on their hips and gestured toward the person with a nod. &ldquo;Well? You gonna help me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Help you with <em>what?&rdquo;</em></p>

<p>&ldquo;I only Suspended it. No idea when they&rsquo;re gonna get all riled up again. Help me get them to CVRS so they can take care of it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d really rather not.&rdquo; He grimaced as he tightened his arms around his stomach. &ldquo;You know I can&rsquo;t stand this stuff. I think I&rsquo;ve had my share for tonight. Or a month. Or two.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, yeah? Would you rather me leave &lsquo;em here for it to come back?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&ndash;you can&rsquo;t just&hellip;&rdquo; He wiggled his fingers vaguely, &ldquo;...properly get rid of it? Like with your bat or something.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Like I said, I <em>Suspended</em> it. I can&rsquo;t Commit it; I don&rsquo;t know anything about their Vice! That would be dangerous!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, and assaulting them into unconsciousness with a magical baseball bat isn&rsquo;t?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yeah, just makes &lsquo;em pass out. If I&rsquo;m not prepared for a Branch and I try to Commit one, they could die! I could die! You could die! Don&rsquo;t you know anything about Vices?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Gah&ndash;quit! Stop! Just take your Suspended Host and get out of here, <em>please!</em>&rdquo;</p>

<p>Emory flipped their hair with a scoff. &ldquo;Not even a <em>thank you</em>? I didn&rsquo;t have to do this, you know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You probably <em>shouldn&rsquo;t</em> have! I still don&rsquo;t understand why you don&rsquo;t leave it to the professionals!&rdquo;</p>

<p>They threw out their arms and gestured theatrically at the empty store around them. &ldquo;See any professionals? I Suspend the Branches the professionals don&rsquo;t know about. That&rsquo;s my whole schtick! If I hadn&rsquo;t been here, this could&rsquo;ve gotten real ugly <em>real</em> quick. And if you don&rsquo;t help me, you&rsquo;re gonna see just how ugly things can get.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d hate to see what you consider ugly,&rdquo; Danny scrunched his nose as he stepped back from the seeping puddle of hissing goo. &ldquo;Fine. What do I need to do?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Just&hellip;you know,&rdquo; Emory gestured to the body. &ldquo;Get &lsquo;em outta here. Firefighter style, bridal style, whatever you fancy. Just don&rsquo;t drag &lsquo;em. Did that once and got the cops called on me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He bent down and inspected the puddle of goo with a wrinkled nose. &ldquo;You sure this stuff&rsquo;s okay to touch?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;For now, yeah. I think. Pretty sure it&rsquo;s inactive so long as we&rsquo;re not in a Branch, so hurry up.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You know I took this job to <em>avoid</em> this kind of stuff, right?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, jokes on you. Seems like there&rsquo;s something about this crummy convenience store that they like. Maybe it&rsquo;s the hot chips.&rdquo; They grabbed a bag from the endcap. &ldquo;These are hard to find, you know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t take too many of those. I like them too.&rdquo; Danny struggled to find the most productive grip on the unconscious Host. They slipped out of his hands as he flinched from Emory&rsquo;s sudden declaration.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Lawrence!&rdquo; they piped up excitedly. &ldquo;Good to see ya&rsquo;!&rdquo;</p>

<p>A scrawny older man carefully stepped from the break room and sighed as Danny awkwardly gathered the slippery Host over his shoulders. &ldquo;Another one?&rdquo; he lamented as he reached for the mop.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yep, unfortunately.&rdquo; Emory stood and adjusted the hem of their pants, puffing out their chest with an accomplished nod. &ldquo;Danny said you think y&rsquo;all are having a string of bad luck. Do you think that&rsquo;s what causing all these Branches?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s to say&hellip;&rdquo; Lawrence sighed as he swirled the mop in the bucket, &ldquo;...all I know is they&rsquo;re starting to become a problem. It&rsquo;s a publicity nightmare. No one wants to stop at a convenience store that&rsquo;s had&hellip;what&rsquo;s it now? Four? Four initiated Branches in three months. It&rsquo;s the last thing we need on top of our staffing and supply shortage. People are going to start talking if they&rsquo;re not already.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m by no means an expert, and I don&rsquo;t have much to say about your shortages since that&rsquo;s outta my wheelhouse, but if you want my unprofessional professional opinion on the Branches&hellip;&rdquo; Emory trailed off as they rummaged in their jacket pockets, &ldquo;...I&rsquo;d give CVRS a call.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They handed Lawrence a worn business card, to which he held his hand up in refusal. &ldquo;Oh, I appreciate your concern, Emory, but there&rsquo;s no way I can afford their services right now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Listen, Lawrence, you know how I feel about CVRS, but I care about you and your supply of hot chips. I&rsquo;ve got a feeling something&rsquo;s off here. In what way, I&rsquo;m not sure, but CVRS is going to give you a bit more long-term support than I&rsquo;d be able to offer. Think about it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Danny huffed as he adjusted the Host across his shoulders. &ldquo;Speaking of, Emory, can we hurry up? This vinegar is singeing my nose hairs.&rdquo;</p>

<span class="divider">/ / /</span>

<p>&ldquo;Another one?&rdquo; Kieran, the Intake Coordinator, peered over her computer screen and sighed at the dripping, unresponsive body draped across Danny&rsquo;s shoulders. She adjusted what appeared to be orange safety glasses on the bridge of her nose as she quickly scanned the body and began typing her observations into the system. She deliberately paused her typing to shoot Emory a stern look before she entered their contact information into the system, now having it memorized.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Floor Manager will be here to initiate intake shortly. In the meantime&hellip;&rdquo; She flipped her glasses down and raised her brows, &ldquo;...how in the world do you keep finding these?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Just got a knack for it, I guess,&rdquo; Emory proudly adjusted their jacket. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re making it easy on me, though. This one was at that same corner store again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Interesting&hellip;&rdquo; she hummed as she typed a couple notes. &ldquo;Another Suspension, I presume?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Same ol&rsquo;, same ol&rsquo;. They didn&rsquo;t put up much of a fight, so I didn&rsquo;t get a chance to see any Blights outside of some pretty pungent vinegar-type stuff coming outta them. As I&rsquo;m sure you can smell. Not sure if I&rsquo;m gonna be much help writing the intake report.&rdquo; Emory restlessly tapped their fingers on the counter. &ldquo;Is Rami running the floor tonight?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He is. And if I remember correctly, he told you to stop playing Target Hunter.&rdquo; She paused her typing to glance up at Emory. &ldquo;Correct?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And? You ever seen Rami scold somebody? Successfully, I mean. He&rsquo;s got the backbone of an overcooked spaghetti noodle.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She failed to suppress a smile as the doors exuberantly flew open beside her. In walked a large, charismatic man with a charmingly fluffy beard and dazzling smile. His white lab coat fluttered behind him as he approached the counter, carrying a welcomed wave of patchouli with him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Emory!&rdquo; he threw his hands out with an amused scoff. &ldquo;Again? What did I tell y&ndash;a-and Danny? Why is the, uh&hellip;why are you&mdash;<em>of all people</em>&mdash;carrying the patient?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Danny adjusted the patient with a grunt. &ldquo;Speaking of, can you please take them? My back&rsquo;s seizing up.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Right, right. Come on back!&rdquo; He opened the door and ushered them to follow.</p>

<p>Emory gave him a couple convincing shoves toward the back doors, and he stumbled forward hesitantly. &ldquo;I-I&rsquo;d really rather n&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;ll be quick! Just set &lsquo;em down right here,&rdquo; Rami gestured to the hospital bed as he began flipping through a clipboard. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll just need you to fill out a report, and&ndash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;O-oh, no. No need to do that. I just carried the body. Emory handled it. They can fill out the report.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s still protocol to gather reports from any available witnesses. It&rsquo;ll only take a few minutes. Unless you got pulled in as Adjuncts. Then we might be here a while. But if I know Emory&rsquo;s methods at all&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Emory yanked the clipboard and pen from his hands. &ldquo;Just a Suspension. He&rsquo;d better not be getting a cut of my stipend.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yeah, wouldn&rsquo;t wanna get in between Emory and their money.&rdquo; Danny awkwardly sluffed the patient from his shoulders and they stumbled onto the bed with an off-putting thud. &ldquo;I really just wanna get out of here. I did my good deed for the day.&rdquo; A familiar uneasiness began to churn deep in his stomach.</p>

<p>Rami relented with a polite sigh. &ldquo;Fine. I know you don&rsquo;t like this stuff, but you missed work for this, right? I&rsquo;ll fill it out for you so you get a stipend. Feel free to wait outside. It&rsquo;ll only be a minute.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What! Why&rsquo;s he getting a stipend? I did all the work!&rdquo; Danny could hear Emory cry as he quickly turned on his heel and sped for the door.</p>

<p>Rami retorted, &ldquo;Is that why you keep doing this? You know if you need money, we can&ndash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No! I&rsquo;m doing it out of the goodness of my heart! And because I&rsquo;m good at it! Money&rsquo;s just a perk that also happens to pay my rent.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;This isn&rsquo;t financially sustainable at all! You&rsquo;d make much more as an official Target Hunter than you&rsquo;ll ever get collecting stipends!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Their budding argument faded as Danny made a bee-line for the exit. He gave Kieran a compulsory nod as he stepped outside and took a deep inhale.</p>

<p>His shoulders slumped with a dramatic exhale as he clumsily bent down to take a seat on the curb. His nausea was catching up with him and as much as he would&rsquo;ve preferred to head home&mdash;the stipend wasn&rsquo;t nearly enough to convince him to stay&mdash;he was afraid any more steps would have urged a very convincing gag.</p>

<p>The trademark CVRS smell of sterile alcohol swabs still lingered in his nostrils, and he dragged his hands down his face with an exhausted groan. He wasn&rsquo;t sure how his nose was able to pick up on it amongst all the vinegar, but even the slightest whiff was able to launch his parasympathetic nervous system into survival mode. He inhaled deeply, hoping the breaths of not-so-fresh city air were enough to fend off the oncoming nausea spell. They wern&rsquo;t.</p>

<p>There wasn&rsquo;t much that could help anymore, short of spending the rest of his day swaddled under a pile of 3 blankets, minimum. Ironically enough, the alcohol swabs that had been originally used to sooth his perpetually uneasy stomach as a child were now one of the worst offenders. The nurses claimed the scent was strong enough to distract the brain and interrupt the budding nausea, but it only worked for him the first couple of times.</p>

<p>He had gotten particularly skilled at warding off these episodes, but only if he had the luxury of being under his covers. Just three nights ago, he was able to prevent an episode by distracting himself with cooking videos, soft blankets, and sweet, musky candles. So long as he was at home, he could get ahead of it and prevent it from spiraling into something unmanageable. But as it turned out, he wasn&rsquo;t home, and even though the humid Texas air was akin to a blanket, it just wasn&rsquo;t cutting it.</p>

<p>Rami poked his head out of the door and called out, &ldquo;Danny! I&rsquo;ve got your&mdash;o-oh no.&rdquo; His shoulders withered with pity as he watched Danny brace himself over a trashcan and heave his stomach contents into the bin. &ldquo;Y-you good? Do I need to check you in?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Danny offered a dismissive wave before returning to the bin to continue his compulsive retching.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, once you&rsquo;re done I&rsquo;ve got your stipend. Don&rsquo;t tell Emory.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Like I&rsquo;m not right here.&rdquo; Emory shoved their way out the door. &ldquo;I thought I convinced you he shouldn&rsquo;t get one!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re gonna look at this pathetic wet-paper-towel-of-a-man and deny him even just a <em>little</em> stipend for helping out tonight? Poor guy coulda just gone home and watched his cooking shows and now he&rsquo;s barfing in a public trash can because you looped him into your shenanigans.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t <em>loop him</em> into anything! Like I said, the Branch just so happened to have been at the corner store. Again! <em>And</em> if I hadn&rsquo;t done anything, he <em>and</em> the Host would&rsquo;ve been dead!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rami rolled his eyes. &ldquo;Oh, come on. Like I said, it was an adolescent Alpha Vice throwing a little fit. The odds of it turning Comatose, let alone Berserk are practically zero. The Host is with our VMT team right now and will probably be discharged in a couple hours. It&rsquo;s not like you prevented a mass Epsilon or Omega Branch.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Danny&rsquo;s retching grew louder as they continued their jargon-filled bickering, and eventually urged Emory to throw their head over their shoulder with a scowl. &ldquo;Dude! That&rsquo;s fucking disgusting, would you <em>quit</em>?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He whipped his head up and returned a scowl of his own. &ldquo;If y&rsquo;all would quit talking about all that shit, I probably would!&rdquo;</p>

<p>A thick, tar-like goo dripped from his chin, causing Rami to defensively grip his clipboard to his chest. &ldquo;Danny, you sure you don&rsquo;t want me to check you in? Gen&rsquo;s still here and could get you some Suppressants to&ndash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Emory raised to their tippy-toes and snatched the stipend from his clipboard. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be taking this, thanks.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;At least buy the poor kid some ramen with it as a thank you. Last time you tried to haul a Host to CVRS by yourself, you got the cops called on you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They were tall! How else was I supposed to transport them other than dragging them?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve done it a million times! It wouldn&rsquo;t have been a problem if you weren&rsquo;t also trying to smuggle a crate of hot chips from the corner store!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Everybody&rsquo;s a critic.&rdquo;</p>
