        <p><em>Danny stood alone in a cold, sterile room. The blinding fluorescent lights buzzed overhead, filling his thoughts with a comforting and familiar static. The room smelled strongly of alcohol swabs. The occasional ticking sound made his jaw tighten, and he looked in each corner of the room for a source of the sound. He confirmed that he was alone, but a gentle, nagging feeling in his shoulders suggested that he wasnâ€™t.</em></p>
        <p>This was the seventh time Danny had this dream in three months.</p>
