                    <p>Danny's alarm violently thrust him into consciousness at 6 a.m., beads of sweat still on his clammy brow. A small trash can sitting next to the bed sizzled steadily, suggesting that he had somehow contorted himself in the night to project a wad of sludge into the bin with startling accuracy. Despite it all, he peeled off the covers and shuffled to the closet, propelled by routine and guided by muscle memory. He tried to ignore the persistent, miserable weight of exhaustion pulling at his joints and waded through the thick slurry of depression to grab a fresh work polo. A light ringing in his ears stoked the smoldering remains of a headache.</p>
                    <p>He stood in his cramped bathroom, hunched over the sink with his eye to the mirror. He pushed up his lip to check his incisors; they were sharper than usual, but not so much that anyone would notice. He raked his fingers through his hair to check for any progress made by the two stumpy horns protruding from the sides of his head. They were slightly less stumpy than usual, a bit taller and somewhat sharper, but his tousled, wavy locks hid them well. He lifted his shirt and ran his finger over the thick scar that stretched across his stomach. He was pleased to report that it was still a scar.</p>
                    <p>He hadn't truly looked at himself separate from his "symptoms" in quite some time, and he barely recognized the stranger in the mirror. His hair was getting long, almost shoulder-length now after a few months of not bothering to cut it. Patches of stubble were dappled across his chin, and his thin mustache had started to fill out, reminding him of his father's. His restless night's sleep accentuated the already heavy bags under his eyes, and his cheeks were beginning to sink in. His diet of granola bars, hot chips, and black coffee wasn't doing him any favors.</p>
                    <p>Any rational person would call in from work after vomiting gallons of sludge, but the thought never crossed his mind. He needed money, and the only way he had to get said money was by going to work; it was as simple as that. Work was, after all, the only way he could convince himself to be out in the world anymore. He knew if he made a habit of not going to work when he didn't feel well, he might never leave his apartment again, so it was the best of his options.</p>
                    <p>That is, of course, until he walked through the store entrance to see Emory chatting with Lucia. He immediately regretted his decision as his headache returned with a vengeance.</p>
                    <p>Emory looked over their shoulder with a bright smile that immediately fell. Their face contorted and scrunched to convey a complex emotion, one of surprise, guilt, and disgust all smashed into one. "Holy shit, man. You look awful."</p>
                    <p>Lucia batted Emory's arm. She was a tall, bony woman of about fifty, her greying hair pulled back into a messy bun. "Be nice to my favorite employee. I'm lucky he's even in today."</p>
                    <p>"I'm not being mean! I just didn't expect him to be here after all that."</p>
                    <p>"Well, I'm here," he grumbled as he squeezed behind the counter and hung a pine-scented air freshener on a hook.</p>
                    <p>Emory leaned toward Lucia, whispering behind their hand, though they never seemed to learn how to properly whisper, so it was more of a breathy, hushed yelling. "Don't you let your employees take sick time?"</p>
                    <p>"Of course I do." She rolled her eyes. "He's a stubborn one, though. Have you ever tried to convince him to do anything?"</p>
                    <p>"All the time. He's easy to push around."</p>
                    <p>"Well, have you ever convinced him to do something <em>good</em> for himself?"</p>
                    <p>"Ah. Never."</p>
                    <p>Danny punched the register closed with a loud chime to remind them he was within hearing distance.</p>
                    <p>"Anyway, Lucia," they pulled back with a spirited grin. "It was great catching up. Here's my number if you ever need me, but I can hang around today to make sure nothing else pops up, just for you."</p>
                    <p>Danny called out from the counter, "Quit acting like you're doing this out of the goodness of your heart." He pointed at Lucia with a raised brow. "They're just using you for your hot chips."</p>
                    <p>"Oh, I know," she patted Emory's shoulder with an amused smirk. "But I do feel better with you around, and peace of mind is worth a couple bags of hot chips. It's not like we're selling anything anyway. Help yourself to some, by all means. I'll be in my office if you need me."</p>
                    <p>Emory flashed Danny a smug grin, then scurried off to their beloved hot chips endcap. He could hear rustling as they stuffed their jacket pockets full. They were not unlike a racoon, he realized, with their tiny hands and tendency to overestimate how much they can carry.</p>
                    <p>"Hey Danny, think fast!" They jumped out from behind the endcap and launched a chip bag directly at his head.</p>
                    <p>He slapped the bag away with an exhausted sigh, almost as if he were expecting it.</p>
                    <p>"Y'know...as thanks or whatever. For helpin' out."</p>
                    <p>"So thoughtful," he grunted as he picked it up off the floor. They nervously drummed their fingers as he tore the bag open and fished around for the chips with the most dust. He popped a dark red chip in his mouth and narrowed his eyes. "Do you need something?"</p>
                    <p>They turned to hide their sheepish pout. "I, uh, I do appreciate your help last night, actually."</p>
                    <p>"I can tell by the hot chips you so graciously threw at me."</p>
                    <p>"I tend to...you know...get caught up in it all, sometimes. It's exhilarating."</p>
                    <p>"I'm glad you get a kick out of it," he grumbled through half-chewed chips.</p>
                    <p>"Listen, I'm sorry, alright? I shouldn't have roped you into that, given your history, so I'll try my absolute best to not loop you into any more of my shenanigans, as Rami put it."</p>
                    <p>He didn't believe them, not so much because they were going to intentionally disregard their own boundary, but more because they would simply forget. Emory did, as they said, tend to get caught up in the whirlwind of excitement that accompanied a Branch Suspension. For what reasons, he would never understand, nor did he particularly care. He simply would have preferred that they went elsewhere and never made him privy to their shenanigans. But for whatever reason, Emory was drawn to his store, much like the Vices seemed to be.</p>
                    <p>"We good?" They raised their brows expectantly, giving his arm a firm slap.</p>
                    <p>"I guess." Any other answer would have sparked an ordeal, and Danny wanted to eat his hot chips in peace.</p>
                    <p>His response was good enough for Emory, who gave him a nod before bounding toward the back of the store. Even if they had promised to keep Danny out of things, it was difficult to ignore them when they went about life at max volume, with no filter, and no situational awareness. He could feel his patience wearing thin as he watched them sniff around the endcap where the Host was Suspended. As in, they were literally on their hands and knees sniffing floor tiles.</p>
                    <p>Emory snapped upright as they sensed his judging eyes on them. Danny kept his mouth shut, but his irritated scowl said enough.</p>
                    <p>"What?" they shrugged, shimmying the endcap out of place.</p>
                    <p>"I hate to ask..." he began cautiously. No matter the answer, he knew he wouldn't like it. But he didn't want to stop them if they were, say, pulling a rat carcass out from underneath the shelves. "What on god's green earth are you doing?"</p>
                    <p>"I've noticed a pattern. Of the nine rogue Branches, six happened somewhere over here."</p>
                    <p>He had clarifying questions, but kept them to himself so as to not encourage them, figuring they would continue regardless.</p>
                    <p>"I dunno exactly what I'm looking for," they continued regardless, "but my theory right now is that something over here is giving off a weird signal. Like a metaphorical molecular trip wire or something. I've heard of rogue Branches being initiated because of sudden changes in electrical charges."</p>
                    <p>"Riveting. I meant why are you smelling the floor."</p>
                    <p>"Oh, it smells like something died over here." They poked their head under the shelves. "But I don't see anything."</p>
                    <p>"Okay, I get it. The store smells like ass. I tried my best." He gestured to the small air freshener hanging above him. "If it gets any worse, I'll call pest control to come look around. Now get off the floor. God forbid we ever have a customer come in."</p>
                    <p>Emory scratched their chin as they mused aloud, "Actually, maybe it's not a dead animal. I can't quite put my finger on it. But it's definitely funky, whatever it is."</p>
                    <p>"I don't know why you're trying to figure that out, of all things. This building is at least 60 years old; plus, it's smelled that way for months. God knows what crawled in the walls and died."</p>
                    <p>They paced up and down the aisle as they shifted their musings to private grumblings and unsheathed a rolled collection of papers from the inner pocket of their utility jacket.</p>
                    <p>Danny rolled his eyes. "Oh, come on. I can't believe you still have that. You've got to stop playing Target Hunter, Emory."</p>
                    <p>In particular, their booklet was a collection of distilled Vice research abstracts distributed by CVRS to their patients, if requested. Though, their copy in particular seemed to have once belonged to an agent, lacking the trite design of an outdated medical brochure that was found all throughout the layman version. The owner information in the top left corner was so wrinkled and smudged from repeated use that the toner had sloughed off, rendering it illegible. It was also quite a few major releases out of date, but they refused to set foot in CVRS as a patient to obtain the latest version. The information wasn't necessarily inaccurate, so much as it was incomplete, but they made do, having scribbled their personal observations in the margins.</p>
                    <p>"Hey, it's what Lucia's paying me to do." They shrugged as they thumbed through the wrinkled pages. "Might as well be informed about my endeavors."</p>
                    <p>"She's not paying you at all. She's just letting you hang around and eat hot chips because she knows you've got nothing better to do."</p>
                    <p>"Okay, fine, she's not paying me, but you heard what she said. She feels better with me around," Emory began as they skimmed a particularly crinkled page, "I mean, it's not like CVRS would get involved with this anyway, so who gives a rip. Like, god forbid our Public Deployment ever lifts a finger, ya know? Both Lucia and I have asked them to come out here and look around, but I swear they only show up after mass casualties or when they take a high-profile case because they need a boost in PR. I've yet to see a successful Target Hunter around here do anything useful and actually <em>prevent</em> stuff." They continued their rant as they pored over the compendium. "If they ever actually do come out to a site, they just poke around with their stupid little machines and their dumb little glasses and go &lsquo;yeah, there might be a Branch tomorrow or next month' or &lsquo;yeah, there was a Branch here an hour or 7 weeks ago' and then stand in the parking lot and pick their nose for 3 hours so they can lie on their report and say their investigation was thorough. You know, sometimes they'll even charge you a fee for poking around. They call it an &lsquo;assurance fee' so you can have the CVRS certified stamp of bullshit on your building and can resume business as usual. As if it means anything to anyone. It's all a con." Emory clapped the compendium closed with a huff.</p>
                    <p>"Aren't you wearing a pair of their dumb little glasses?"</p>
                    <p>They flicked at the plastic case around the amber lenses. "This is the one time they did something right, but it's an outdated design, apparently. I don't know why all Parsing Goggles don't look like this."</p>
                    <p>"They're a bit much." Their vintage aviation goggles stuck out like a sore thumb among modern fashion, and Danny tried to imagine Gen or Rami wearing them en lieu of their standard eyewear, much to his amusement.</p>
                    <p>"That's because you have bad taste."</p>
                    <p>"The gloves are CVRS, too, aren't they? For someone who shits on them so much, you sure do like co-opting their aesthetics. How'd you even get that version of the compendium anyway? I thought they only gave those out to agents."</p>
                    <p>Emory's shoulders flinched at the sound of a van door slamming outside. "What are you, a cop? I'm gonna go look in the back for anything suspicious." They scampered off to Lucia's office as the bell above the front door chimed.</p>
                    <p>Danny turned to see a familiar face approaching the counter, and his chest swelled with excitement. A short, toned man with half-shaved, platinum blonde hair flashed a charming smile. He was dressed casually, with orange-tinted, wayfarer-style sunglasses sitting atop the bridge of his strong nose. He carried himself with a level of confidence that Danny both envied and adored. There was someone else with him, but Danny's eyes were fixed on him.</p>
                    <p>"Eli! Oh my god, hi!" he perked up, suddenly self conscious of his bed-head and patchy, stubbly, chin.</p>
                    <p>"Danny, good to see you!" His voice was warm and strong, but smooth like a high-end bourbon. "Sorry to drop in unannounced. This area's Public Deployment has been stretched thin, so they reached out to our station to help cover this route last-minute. Hope we're not imposing."</p>
                    <p>Eli was a suave, charismatic man of many talents, his current pursuit being a Target Hunter for Public Deployment, and a fairly accomplished one at that. He had originally befriended Danny and his circle in his previous role as a bartender at an easy-going pub a few miles away. The two hadn't seen each other since Eli left the bar, roughly four months ago, and Danny felt a bit odd seeing him out from behind the counter, without a cocktail shaker in hand.</p>
                    <p>"O-oh, not at all. Glad you&mdash;<em>y'all</em> are here," Danny cleared his throat.</p>
                    <p>Eli nodded to the large, broad-shouldered woman in navy coveralls behind him. "This is our trusty Branch Admin, Frankie. She has a wealth of experience and specializes in rogue Branches, which brings me to our case. Rami actually gave me the brief earlier&mdash;it was so good to see him again&mdash;and he said there was a Suspended Branch here last night that their Public Deployment was unaware of. Do you know anything about that?"</p>
                    <p>"Somewhat."</p>
                    <p>"Rami also said Emory was there?"</p>
                    <p>"Unfortunately."</p>
                    <p>Eli smirked as he began clicking away on the pager-like device clipped to the waistband of his jeans. A MobiComm, as Danny had learned from Rami and Gen's chronic usage, was a small, hand-held device used to communicate with other CVRS agents, take notes, or, in Gen's case, log observations.</p>
                    <p>Frankie gave him firm pat on the shoulder. "While you get that down, I'm gonna go talk to the manager." She then strutted off toward Lucia's office.</p>
                    <p>He looked up at Danny with a chuckle. "Emory's becoming a bit of celebrity around here, you know. And not just at Rami's station; ours, too. We have a shorthand in our system that essentially says &lsquo;Emory was here'."</p>
                    <p>"I'm not shocked in the slightest. I keep telling them to just get a job with y'all, but they're just. You know. Emory."</p>
                    <p>"Well, I also know you don't like to talk about these things, Danny, so I'll keep it brief. Just knowing they were here gives me more information than you'd expect, actually. After Frankie talks with the store owner, she'll do a quick sweep, then we'll head out. So, just a few questions for you. Seen anything unusual here today?"</p>
                    <p>"You're gonna have to define unusual."</p>
                    <p>The door to Lucia's office was suddenly thrown open with a slam, and Emory bolted for the exit, skittering across the floor like a startled stray cat. Frankie instinctively grabbed them by the hood of their jacket and effortlessly lifted their tiny frame off the ground. "Well, if it isn't the infamous Emory Torres. I have some questions for you." She tossed them into the office and shut the door behind them with a slam.</p>
                    <p>"Oh, was that&mdash;?"</p>
                    <p>"Emory, yeah." Danny held his head in his hands. "They were here when I clocked in this morning."</p>
                    <p>"What for?"</p>
                    <p>"Playing Target Hunter, of course."</p>
                    <p>Eli straightened his jacket with a smirk. "Should I be flattered?"</p>
                    <p>"Oh, not at all. They're bastardizing your craft."</p>
                    <p>"Well, either way, they're done for," he tutted. "Frankie might strangle them."</p>
                    <p>"Didn't realize they were such a menace for y'all, too. I guess that makes sense why y'all have your shorthand for them."</p>
                    <p>"They're the talk of the office, in a good or bad way depending on who you're talking to. I mean, it's hard not to stir up some office gossip when some random citizen is racking up more Suspensions than their local Public Deployment department. Some are praising their initiative, others are fascinated by them on a psychological level, but Frankie is being very objective about all this, very by-the-book, like she always is. She's a stickler for the rules and very passionate about her work, and Emory is, well, like you said, bastardizing it."</p>
                    <p>Behind the door, Emory was crouching behind Lucia, who was seated at her desk. Frankie stood looming over them with a perfectly neutral expression, but her stature added an air of intimidation.</p>
                    <p>She leaned down and extended a hand out to Lucia. "Frankie Scott, Branch Admin, CVRS North. I have some questions for you in regards to the rogue Branch that was initiated last night."</p>
                    <p>"Oh, o-of course." She took her hand, and Frankie gave her a firm shake. "I must say I'm surprised. I can't remember the last time CVRS gave me the time of day."</p>
                    <p>"I'm sorry to hear that. Do you remember who gave you trouble? If you have their name, I can go to admin, and&mdash;"</p>
                    <p>"No, no, it's not like that. I'm just happy someone's here now." Lucia gestured to the two empty chairs before her. "Please, have a seat. Emory, you, too. You can't hide behind me forever."</p>
                    <p>Frankie squeezed into the chair near the door, intending to block Emory from darting out. "The report mentioned this area has been a bit of a hotspot for rogue Branches lately. Can you expand on that?"</p>
                    <p>"Oh, not that well, no. That's all there is to it, really. Emory told me that was the ninth rogue Branch here in four months."</p>
                    <p>"I saw eight in the file for on-prem Branches. Are you also including the one outside of your entrance?"</p>
                    <p>"Yes, I think Emory mentioned one was initiated in the store, but wasn't addressed until they were outside."</p>
                    <p>"Hm. How aggressive were each of the Hosts? Were they mostly calm or did they seem agitated?"</p>
                    <p>Lucia ushered Emory out from behind her with a sigh. "Do me a favor and talk about this for me, will you? You're much more familiar with it, please."</p>
                    <p>Emory shuffled out and around her desk, stooped over in embarrassment. They squeezed behind Frankie to take the empty seat beside her, then scooted to the side to put a bit of space between them. "One or two of the Hosts seemed depressed, but most of them were agitated. I had one actually try to pick a fight."</p>
                    <p>"What were their blights like?"</p>
                    <p>"Pretty standard, I guess. Not any worse than they tend to be before Branches in my experience."</p>
                    <p>"And how did you know they were rogue Branches?"</p>
                    <p>"Well, I dunno who willingly initiates a Branch in public, so I just assumed&mdash;"</p>
                    <p>"You know what they say about assumptions," Frankie interrupted. "I think you completely misunderstand the concept of a rogue Branch. Just because a Branch is in public, doesn't mean it's rogue. Rogue implies it's deviated from the established Branch formula. That being said, I can't speak to your accuracy on Branches outside of the store, but for those that happened here, you weren't wrong. All nine of these Branches were determined to be rogue after interviews with the Hosts."</p>
                    <p>"Okay? So what's the problem?"</p>
                    <p>"You, running around <em>assuming</em> and imposing yourself on people's circumstances. It is incredibly reckless, audacious, and downright negligent to go around masquerading as some Vice vigilante when you don't seem to have a clue about the risks you're exposing these people to."</p>
                    <p>"What makes you think I don't have a clue what I'm doing?"</p>
                    <p>"Because you've Suspended <em>all</em> of them." They could practically feel the imminent scolding as Frankie slowly turned to them, nearly hovering over of her seat. "Tell me, Emory. Why Suspension?"</p>
                    <p>"I...thought it was the safest option."</p>
                    <p>She was quiet for a moment, studying their expression for authenticity. "Do you know what happens when a Branch is Suspended?"</p>
                    <p>"Yeah," Emory straightened cautiously. "The Vice feels threatened, so it stops growing and terminates the Branch."</p>
                    <p>"Simply speaking, yes. But Suspensions do not undo the progress made by an advancing Vice, like Commits do. Suspensions simply halt the progress and buy time, doing little to actually address the problem at hand. Most Suspensions result in an aggravated Vice and more severe subsequent Branches. Not only that, but when you Suspend a Branch&mdash;especially as carelessly as you do&mdash;Vice spores spread <em>everywhere</em>." Her voice was calm, but her eyes were intense, wide and focused on them. She began slowly rising from her seat. "When a Branch is initiated, the Host's body swarms with spores as the Vice Core advances, and when someone like you comes along with a hammer&mdash;"</p>
                    <p>"Baseball bat," Emory corrected.</p>
                    <p>"&mdash;a <em>baseball bat</em>, as if that's any better, and you <em>assault</em> the Host and beat them into submission, massive concentrations of these spores are expelled from the Host's body and splatter across the room." Frankie had fully risen to her feet. "Not only are you risking severe bodily injury and aggravating Vices by performing these Suspensions, you are <em>actively</em> aiding in the continued procreation of Vices. Do you understand that, Emory?"</p>
                    <p>They were gripping their seat, sweating furiously. "I-I-I didn't before, but I do now."</p>
                    <p>"Now hold on a minute," Lucia interjected. "While I'll admit I'm the least educated out of everyone here, would you not agree that a Suspension is better than the alternative? If Emory wasn't here, these people would have been unattended."</p>
                    <p>"Not all unattended Branches end in Propagation." Frankie turned to her. "Many&mdash;actually, the <em>majority</em> of Vices are able to be Committed by the Host alone. Rogue Branches are typically indicative of adolescent Vices, not mature ones. You can't make a blanket statement that any and all unattended Branches need to be Suspended. We're trained to only use it as a last resort."</p>
                    <p>"That's what I'm doing!" Emory whipped the crumpled papers from their jacket and furiously waved them in the air. "You said it yourself! And in here, it says that if a more qualified agent isn't available, then Suspension may be performed to buy the Host time to enlist the help needed."</p>
                    <p>"Don't quote the compendium at me." Frankie offered a sternly pointed finger. "And if my eyes don't deceive me, that is not only an outdated copy, but one that belongs to an agent. The guidance in the compendium is to inform patients of their options and to advise certified CVRS agents who have received the proper training and are informed enough to make that decision. It is not for self-proclaimed vigilantes who run around assaulting people with a bat. I don't think you understand how lucky you are that you haven't been reported yet, or worse."</p>
                    <p>"You're joking, right?" Emory rose to their feet as a futile attempt to bolster their intimidation factor. "I'm trying to fill in where our CVRS is failing! You can't get mad at me for seeing all these rogue Branches and doing something about it while Public Deployment is just sitting on their ass."</p>
                    <p>"I will never shame someone for seeing a problem and taking action, but the action you are taking is unnecessary and uninformed. These Hosts could have had severe side effects from your negligence, and you would be none the wiser."</p>
                    <p>Emory was glassy-eyed as mixed emotions erupted in their chest.</p>
                    <p>"It is beyond audacious and arrogant," Frankie continued, "to not only believe, but to act on the belief that you, a layman, know more than your Public Deployment team."</p>
                    <p>"Whoa, whoa, whoa! Haven't you heard?" They brought a hand to their ear. "Our Public Deployment team is full of lazy and incompetent morons!"</p>
                    <p>"It is my understanding they are simply understaffed, not lazy or incompetent."</p>
                    <p>Emory let out a single, pointed, "Hah!"</p>
                    <p>"You disagree."</p>
                    <p>"Not only has Public Deployment not prevented any Branches in the last six months&mdash;"</p>
                    <p>"Untrue."</p>
                    <p>"&mdash;but they have <em>yet</em> to actually investigate the store despite the fact that we've repeatedly begged them to!"</p>
                    <p>She looked to the ceiling, pursing her lips slightly. "Oh, I'm sorry." Her tone was flat, but she seemed genuine. "I was operating under the impression that the local Public Deployment team had already investigated the store. Is that not true?"</p>
                    <p>Lucia perked up. "I dunno what your definition of &lsquo;investigate' at CVRS is, but they certainly haven't done that here. Maybe you're thinking of the third Branch, the one that was outside the store. It was more public, and Emory had drawn quite the crowd, so they had no problem doing their whole rigmarole."</p>
                    <p>Frankie pulled out a small tablet and began tabbing through documents with a stern frown. "No, it says here a walkthrough investigation was performed for one of the Branches that happened on-prem."</p>
                    <p>"Well, I guess they did technically come out for the sixth one. I think they got tired of me asking, so they sent someone out to look around so I'd leave them alone. They weren't exactly thorough."</p>
                    <p>She picked at the worn corner of the tablet's rubber cover. "I suppose that's why the report isn't very detailed."</p>
                    <p>Emory chimed in, "I watched them do the walkthrough, too, and they didn't even pull out a VGMeter! I even told them quite a few Branches had happened toward the back of the store, and they didn't even go back there to check it out!"</p>
                    <p>Her jaw was tight. "I see."</p>
                    <p>"Every time I talked with CVRS," Lucia began, "I felt like I was inconveniencing them. They always had an excuse for not coming out, hiding behind vague protocols and complaints of being understaffed. Really, I just need some peace of mind."</p>
                    <p>"Hm." Frankie clicked a few lines into her MobiComm. "If agents are using protocols as a way to get out of work, then they have no business being affiliated with CVRS." She faced her with a decisive nod. "I can't speak for what previous Public Deployment teams have done, but since the most recent Branch did happen on the store's property, Eli and I can conduct a walkthrough after I perform Branch cleanup."</p>
                    <p>Lucia clasped Frankie's hand in hers and held it to her forehead as she exhaled a sigh of relief. "Oh, thank god. Thank you, Frankie. I just need one less thing to worry about."</p>
                    <p>"Mmm," she mused, awkwardly slipping her hand from her grasp. "Happy to help." She took Lucia's ring of keys and looked over her shoulder at Emory. "I still do not condone your behavior. I find it borderline barbaric the way you tactlessly swing that bat around. I no longer think you're arrogant, but I still think your actions are reckless, uninformed, and dangerous. If I so much as hear you're thinking about continuing with your vigilantism, I'm reporting you." She threw the door open with a slam.</p>
                    <p>Eli had been leaning on the counter as he talked with Danny, and his elbow nearly slipped off in surprise. "Frankie! What&mdash;"</p>
                    <p>"As you were; I'll handle cleanup." She flipped down a pair of orange safety glasses and tapped the steel toe of her boots against the floor. "Continue your interview."</p>
                    <p>Danny smirked. "Oh, is that what you're supposed to be doing?"</p>
                    <p>Eli turned back to him with a stifled smile. "We're, uh...we're asking each other questions. This is an interview of sorts." He cleared his throat. "Now, what did you ask me?"</p>
                    <p>"How you're liking CVRS."</p>
                    <p>"Right, right. Well, thank you for asking, Danny, but I know you're the last person who wants to hear about it."</p>
                    <p>"I, uh...I do wanna hear about your job, in theory; I just wish it was literally anything else. How does it compare to bartending?"</p>
                    <p>"They're so different, it's hard to say. I enjoyed bartending for a lot of reasons; I loved the showmanship of it, and the social aspect of it, meeting so many interesting people." He paused with a thoughtful smile. "I'm glad I did it, and I wouldn't trade anything for it. But being a Target Hunter is rewarding in a different way. I'm not doing it for CVRS, I'm doing it for the people. I think that's my favorite part, being able to meet people in new ways."</p>
                    <p>Danny planted his elbows on the counter and held his chin in his hands as he sighed wistfully, "I wish all CVRS agents had your bedside manner, Eli. You're so noble, and people love talking with you. You really know how to, just...um..." Eli's gaze was fixed expectantly on him, ushering a wash of pink across his cheeks. "Word good. You make good words."</p>
                    <p>"Why thank you," he chuckled. "I'll have to write that on a sticky note and add it to my daily affirmations. Oh, and speaking of bartending, I saw Charlie the other day. She told me she hasn't seen you at the bar in a while. Did you stop going?"</p>
                    <p>"O-oh. Yeah." He had attempted a visit shortly after Eli left, but found the outing dull and unfulfilling. It wasn't from any lack of social skills on the staff's part; rather, it was because for so long, Danny had relied on Eli's effortless responses to keep the conversation interesting when his articulatory shortcomings plagued him. Plus, it was a bit easier to ignore the heavy weight of exhaustion when Eli was the one playfully bantering and serving drinks with a flourish. The other bartenders just didn't have the same appeal, in his opinion. "I, uh...don't really see the point anymore."</p>
                    <p>Eli rested on the counter and leaned toward him with a quizzical tilt of his head. "In going out and having a good time?"</p>
                    <p>"Well, no." Actually yes, but that was beside the point. "Just, uh...i-it's not as fun without you there."</p>
                    <p>"Oh!" Eli struggled to suppress a growing smile. "That's a very sweet sentiment, Danny, thank you."</p>
                    <p>His cheeks were growing red as he stammered, "Well, y-you know what I mean, it's just&mdash;it's not the same, you know? I like the way you make drinks."</p>
                    <p>"Danny, if you want me to make you a drink, all you have to do is ask. I have a pretty stocked bar at home. You're welcome to come over whenever you want."</p>
                    <p>"N-n-no, that's okay," he squeaked. Steam was practically pouring from his ears. "It's just&mdash;I'm such a creature of habit, you know? A-and when you change things up on me, I get weirded out. Guess I'm just not a big fan of change, haha!"</p>
                    <p>"Hm, you changed your hair, though. It's gotten so long," he mused softly with a gentle smile as he eyed the loose, coffee-brown ringlets that cascaded down his neck and curled at his shoulders. "I can't believe it's grown that much so fast."</p>
                    <p>"O-oh, god, yeah, not intentional." He nervously twisted a strand around his finger and let it unfurl into a loose curl. "I keep forgetting to go get it cut."</p>
                    <p>"No, no! I think it looks nice. I don't think I've ever seen you with hair this long, is all I'm saying. Keep it, it's very handsome on you."</p>
                    <p>He began twisting another strand, then paused, his blood pressure skyrocketing as he processed his compliment. He quickly released the curl and nervously pulled his hair back behind him. "Geez, Eli, you know you don't have to say stuff like that anymore now that you're not trying to get a tip out of me. Unless we're supposed to tip Target Hunters, too."</p>
                    <p>A vein jutted from his neck as he clenched his jaw. Danny was never one to accept compliments, no matter how hard Eli tried. "Aw," he chuckled softly, an impish grin creeping across his face. "I always thought you tipped nicely because you liked me."</p>
                    <p>Danny's face went beet-red as he stammered out an incoherent string of interjections.</p>
                    <p>"Eli." Frankie popped up from behind the endcap, and the two nearly jumped out of their skin, having completely forgotten she was there. "I've finished cleaning. Let's do a walkthrough."</p>
                    <p>"Right, well," Eli straightened and shot Danny a mischievous glance with a snap of his glove. "I should get to work."</p>
                    <p>"Glasses on, and get your meter out. I want a full sweep. Document any anomalies in the case file."</p>
                    <p>"Roger that." He flipped his glasses down and pulled a slim device from his jacket pocket. Two prongs sat at the top of a thick plastic case, and a number fluctuated on the digital screen as he pointed it around the room.</p>
                    <p>"Everything seems stable over here." He dragged the meter along the baseboards near the entrance. "I'm getting a soft 5, but that's not surprising considering last night's Suspension."</p>
                    <p>"Same here, but I'm getting a hard 6 since I'm closer to the Suspension site." Through her glasses, Frankie could see the solid white splatters of light that painted the doors to the drink cooler and the puddles of sparkling light pooling around the endcap.</p>
                    <p>Eli ran the meter along the bottom of the counter, then popped upright to playfully point it at Danny. It jumped to an 8, and Eli furrowed his brow. He flicked the screen, then looked up at him with concern. "Do you feel alright?"</p>
                    <p>"Y-yeah?" His blood pressure still hadn't equalized and he was absurdly tired, but in terms of what the meter was looking for, he felt fine.</p>
                    <p>Eli adjusted his glasses as he looked down at his own arm, faint tendrils of light branching down his forearm like veins. He looked back up to see the fuzzy white motes of light hovering around Danny, but his body was completely free of any indication there was a Vice living inside of him. "Oh, huh."</p>
                    <p>"What?" Danny swatted at his arms like he had bugs crawling on him. "What do you see?"</p>
                    <p>"That's just it, I don't see anything." Eli shook the meter and flicked at the screen, but it continued reading him at a solid 8.6. He logged a few lines into his MobiComm.</p>
                    <p>"What! What are you writing down?" Danny lunged over the counter, as if he would be able to see Eli's notes.</p>
                    <p>"Nothing, it's fine! I just think my meter's busted." There was a bit of hesitation in his voice, but Danny was too frazzled to pick up on it. It was one thing for the technologically-unreliable meter to give false readings, but something else entirely for the non-digital glasses to not show even a bit of light coming off of him. Eli kept it to himself; if Danny knew something about him was entered into the system as an "anomaly" he would have lost his mind.</p>
                    <p>"Eli." Frankie's stern voice made him jump. She was standing at the back hallway, her meter pointed forward. "Come here."</p>
                    <p>He glanced up at Danny with a crooked smile before trotting over to her.</p>
                    <p>The short hallway led to the exit. The right was lined with ATMs and newspaper stands, with a door to the restroom near the exit. On the left, two cork bulletin boards littered with faded paper ads flanked the door to the storage room. A musty funk hung in the air.</p>
                    <p>He peered over at Frankie's meter, both of theirs matching at a soft 7. "Huh."</p>
                    <p>"Something's up over here. You can get the bathroom since I did cleanup."</p>
                    <p>He slipped in the restroom with a relenting sigh as she opened the door to the storage room. She flipped on the light to see stacks of boxes covered in a thin layer of dust. Through her glasses, she could see a dazzling white mist hanging around the ceiling toward the back. She perked up and pulled a rather intimidating device from her pockets.</p>
                    <p>"Oh, um, Frankie? Is that really necessary?" Lucia hurried over to her, cautiously eyeing the contraption in Frankie's hand that suspiciously resembled a stun grenade. Emory scampered up behind her, oogling the unknown apparatus.</p>
                    <p>Frankie pointed to the haze that hung in the back of the storage room. "Remember those spores I was talking about earlier? You've got a whole lot of them back there."</p>
                    <p>To Lucia and Emory, it was a dense, black cloud, slightly opaque and undulating. Her face was twisted in disgust, but theirs was bright and exuberant.</p>
                    <p>"Why is it there?" Lucia furrowed her brow, pulling her shawl tightly around her.</p>
                    <p>"Any number of reasons." Frankie poked her head in and looked around the room, paying special attention to where the ceiling met the wall. "I don't see anything causing it. VG&mdash;the spores, that's what we call them; short for <em>vitiumglomerorum</em>&mdash;sometimes get caught in rooms without a lot of ventilation, so if you haven't been in here much, it could just be where they're congregating. And with the number of Suspensions that have been performed nearby over the last few months, this doesn't surprise me in the slightest. It was probably a vicious cycle of messy Suspensions, more spores congregated, so more rogue Branches were initiated. I wouldn't be concerned."</p>
                    <p>"Are they alive?" She seemed concerned regardless, evident by the growing number of wrinkles in her forehead. "It almost looks like a swarm of bugs."</p>
                    <p>"Oh, not at all." Frankie pulled the pin and tossed the flashbang into the room with a slam of the door. "Cover your ears."</p>
                    <p>Emory and Lucia covered their heads and squeezed their eyes shut. A deafening bang blasted through the store, and beams of brilliant cyan shot from the gaps in the door frame. Danny, who had intentionally been ignoring them as he tried to lower his heart rate, bolted upright and hit his head on the overhead storage. The light behind the door quickly faded, and Eli came bumbling out of the restroom, gripping his chest. "Frankie! Was that an AVCharge?"</p>
                    <p>"Yes."</p>
                    <p>"Warn me next time, will you?" He cleared his throat and smoothed the wrinkles in his shirt. "Apologies for the aggressive tactics, Lucia. But we do try to be efficient with our time."</p>
                    <p>"Not a problem at all," she shouted, tugging on her ear.</p>
                    <p>"The effects of an AVCharge are nearly instant," Eli explained. "So if this room was the cause of the rogue Branches, you should see a drastic decrease in them almost immediately. VG also tend to make people subconsciously uncomfortable, and high concentrations have been known to make people sick. So regardless, things should feel a bit lighter around here."</p>
                    <p>"Oh!" Lucia brought her hand to her chest. "That's wonderful to hear. Exactly what I hoped for. I can't thank you enough."</p>
                    <p>As Lucia was praising and thanking the two for their work, Emory had tiptoed behind Frankie and curiously poked their head into the room. It was the same as before, untouched and unfazed; though the black mist had disappeared, and it seemed unnaturally bright for a room without windows and a single, wimpy bulb. The persistent, funky smell had somewhat relented, and the room mostly smelled of cardboard and old carpet.</p>
                    <p>"Awesome," they whispered as they flipped through the pages of the compendium, hoping to find more information about the curious device. They backed out of the room, startled by the solid frame behind them.</p>
                    <p>Frankie peered down at them as she tapped her safety glasses into her chest pocket. "While I will thank you for bringing the local Public Deployment's shortcomings to my attention, that is all I can thank you for. I do hope you take to heart our conversation earlier. If not, you will be reported." She glanced down at the papers clutched in their hand, then whipped them from their grasp with a click of her teeth. "And this is CVRS property. If you wish to view the contents of the Vice Research Compendium, then you are welcome to request one from your Vice Management Specialist. That is all."</p>
                    <p>Frankie straightened and gave Lucia a nod. "Thank you for having us, Lucia. You have my card if anything else comes up." She patted Eli on the back, ushering him toward the exit.</p>
                    <p>He quickly looked over his shoulder for Danny, who was busy rearranging the front counter. He noticed Eli's gaze and perked up, giving him a small wave with a smile. Perhaps it was the light still pouring from the storage room, but Eli thought that Danny looked a bit brighter.</p>
