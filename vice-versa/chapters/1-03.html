                    <p>As the door clicked shut and the store fell silent, Danny could feel a brightness swelling in his chest. It was an uncomfortable restlessness, a nervous energy that would tumble down his arms in waves of sharp prickles. A heavy tension had settled in the air, and he felt a shame so potent, so tangible that it urged a clammy sweat across his brow. About what, he wasn't entirely sure. The preemptive shame of asking for help, perhaps; though he didn't even know what he was considering asking for help with. Was there even anything wrong? Was the needle-like sensation pulsing through his veins an objective negative? It certainly wasn't an objective positive. If anything, it just felt foreign, almost alien in its sheer intensity.</p>
                    <p>Even if he wanted to speak up, his chest was so tight, he wasn't sure if anything would come out. He hoped the feeling would simply pass or he would at least get used to it, since Lucia and Emory seemed to be preoccupied anyway, their backs turned to him. His restless hands began rummaging around the countertop to find something to pass the time.</p>
                    <p>Emory was left standing in front of the storage room. They were staring through their empty hands, their eyes glassy with brimming tears. Lucia's hand gently came to rest on their shoulder as a tear spilled down their cheek.</p>
                    <p>"Dunno why the hell she had to take the damn thing from me." They furiously rubbed their dampened cheek on the sleeve of their jacket. "Might as well have ripped off my gloves and goggles and stripped me of my dignity while she was at it."</p>
                    <p>Lucia wasn't entirely sure how to respond. Over the last few months especially, she had come to appreciate Emory's regular visits and looked forward to their energetic personality, a bright spot in a truly stressful time. But if what Frankie had said was true&mdash;that Emory's indiscriminate and reckless suspensions had actually contributed to the store's string of bad luck&mdash;she simply had a mix of complex emotions she wouldn't be able to hide in her tone. She knew she would only be able to offer shallow condolences, and Emory didn't particularly strike her as someone who would respond well to such.</p>
                    <p>"That was at least a year's worth of observations. Gone! Just like that! Like she thought I didn't get the hint before. Don't worry, Frankie! I got it; I'm just making everything worse! You didn't have to rub my face in it!"</p>
                    <p>"It was a bit much, wasn't it? I thought she'd already made her point pretty clearly."</p>
                    <p>"Ugh, thank you! She was probably just on a stupid power trip or something. Kicking the little guy when they're already down! Tsk tsk," they tutted disapprovingly.</p>
                    <p>"Oh, come on, she doesn't really seem the type, does she?"</p>
                    <p>"What, do you know her personally or something?"</p>
                    <p>"I'm just saying, she seems more concerned with doing her job well, not like she's on some quest for power."</p>
                    <p>"Are you on my side or not?"</p>
                    <p>Lucia regretted saying anything at all. "I don't think there's any sides here, Emory. Just facts."</p>
                    <p>"Okay, sure, what're the facts then? Do tell."</p>
                    <p>"I don't think you're in a position to be giving me attitude, all things considered."</p>
                    <p>"Why? Because everything is actually all my fault? You think I don't know that?"</p>
                    <p>Emory and Lucia winced as a metallic screech suddenly tore through the store. They turned to see Danny hunched over the front counter, furiously scraping at the years of gunk caked on the tile backsplash with a rusted paint scraper. He was somehow completely unaware of the grating squall wreaking havoc on their eardrums.</p>
                    <p>Emory furrowed their brow. "What the fuck is he doing?"</p>
                    <p>"I...actually have no idea."</p>
                    <p>"Ayo, Danny!"</p>
                    <p>He whipped his head up with wide eyes, his pupils having shrunk to no more than a spec of black in a sea of glistening amber. His fingers trembled around the handle, and the rusted edge let out a shaky, high pitched squeal as it agonizingly scraped along the smooth ceramic glaze. He stared straight through them with a tense jaw, unable to reply.</p>
                    <p>"Dude, lighten up. What the hell's wrong with you?"</p>
                    <p>The plastic handle was beginning to splinter in his white-knuckled fist. "Sorry," he breathed softly, color gradually returning to his knuckles as he loosened his grip.</p>
                    <p>Lucia tilted her head with concern. "Are you feeling alright?"</p>
                    <p>The longer he went without a distraction, the more the buzzing in his head began to feel like sandpaper against his brain, and the directionless energy soon turned to a restless agitation that had him biting the inside of his cheek until it bled.</p>
                    <p>"You can take the day off if you need to. I know this has been a lot for you these last two days."</p>
                    <p>"I'm okay," he exhaled sharply. Beads of sweat were gathering across his brow as pressure began to build against his temples.</p>
                    <p>"What do you mean it's been a lot for him?" Emory threw their hands up with a scoff. "I just had the worst day of my life while his stupid boytoy just flirted with him for an hour. If anything, I should be the one that gets to take off!"</p>
                    <p>"You don't even work here, Emory."</p>
                    <p>"Well, my point still stands! Dunno why you feel so compelled to extend him sympathy when I just had my hopes and dreams and dignity ripped away from me. He's fucking fine, he's just being a w&mdash;"</p>
                    <p>The paint scraper suddenly whizzed past their cheek, just barely nicking their skin. It smacked against the wall behind them and fell with a tinny clatter that pierced through the tense silence. Danny was in shock, his extended arm frozen in mid-air. As Emory turned to face him with an almost crazed expression, he brought his hands up defensively as he began stammering incomprehensibly.</p>
                    <p>"Em&mdash;I-I, uh&mdash;I'm sorry...I don't&mdash;"</p>
                    <p>"As if my day wasn't bad enough..." They stormed over to him and grabbed him by the shirt, pinning him against the counter. "You just had to go and do that, didn't you? Do you have a death wish?"</p>
                    <p>"I-I wasn't&mdash;I didn't even...that wasn't me&mdash;I-I didn't mean to do that!" A swirling pressure began building deep in the back of his throat. It wasn't the familiar knot of disgust that came before vomiting; it was a tingling sensation, almost as if the staticky brightness was insisting its way up his throat.</p>
                    <p>"I don't care what you <em>meant</em> to do, you fucking freak. You&mdash;and yes it <em>was</em> you&mdash;threw a paint scraper at my head with intent to kill, so now I have to kill you. It's only fair."</p>
                    <p>The pressure against his temples was almost nauseating, and a searing heat singed the back of his mouth. A sour twang spread along the sides of his tongue as he weakly tried to push them back. A clammy sweat broke out down his neck as the sensation brimmed at the top of his throat. "S-something's wrong."</p>
                    <p>"With you?" Emory laughed, then tightened their grip, slamming their fists against his chest. "Yeah man, we know."</p>
                    <p>He shoved their head to the side as he lurched forward, and a spurt of shimmering light sputtered from his lips. It was grainy, crunching between his clenched teeth, and tasted of bright citrus.</p>
                    <p>Viscous globs of bright cyan dribbled down Emory's sleeve and they backed up in disgust, frantically shaking it from their arm. "Oh, gross! What the fuck, man?"</p>
                    <p>Danny braced himself against their shoulder as another burst of light built in his mouth until it spilled from his lips and seeped from his nose. He opened his mouth at an attempt to catch his breath and the clot of light that had gathered behind his teeth tumbled from his lips and landed on the floor with a squelch, sizzling into a fine mist.</p>
                    <p>"I think I'm dying," he proclaimed nasally, still struggling to take a breath with the gummy sinews plugging his sinuses.</p>
                    <p>"What, trying to get out of getting your ass kicked?" They eyed the shimmering teal goop dripping from his lips. "I thought the shit you barfed up was black."</p>
                    <p>"S'not that," he slurred as his vision began to blur, the pressure becoming unbearable. He clumsily brought his hand to cover their face as he pushed them to the side.</p>
                    <p>Danny launched himself forward with what was quite possibly the loudest sneeze he had ever uttered in his entire life, folding over and sternutating into his elbow with an intensity that shook him to his core.</p>
                    <p>They broke their angry facade with a snort. "Pfft, dude. You sneeze like my grandpa."</p>
                    <p>He straightened with a pained grimace, tacky strings of bright cyan stretching from his nose to his inner elbow.</p>
                    <p>They wrinkled their nose in disgust. "But you have the hygiene of a toddler."</p>
                    <p>"Emory, please&mdash;" He was cut off by another soul-shattering sneeze that expelled another smattering of radiant blue goop from his sinuses. He could taste blood as the gritty liquid light scraped against his throat.</p>
                    <p>"Okay, alright. I think I see what's going on here." They backed up and smugly crossed their arms. "Weird time for it to happen, but congrats I guess."</p>
                    <p><em>"Congrats?"</em> If there wasn't an overwhelming pressure in his throat urging him to sneeze, thick globs of light were constantly working their way up his throat and seeping from his nose. He felt like he was drowning from the inside and his sinuses were slowly filling with glue, not exactly something that warranted felicitations.</p>
                    <p>"AV is usually, like...dusty. No idea why it's all snotty like that."</p>
                    <p>"Is that what this is?" He held out his arm and shook the strands of light from his elbow. AV was typically only visible when wielding a patch outside of a Branch, and in the even rarer instance of seeing an AVCharge go off, though the two seemed to be common occurrences around him as of late. He didn't think it could ball up in his sinuses like magical snot.</p>
                    <p>"Yeah, man. Like I said, congrats. You're finally getting your patch. I guess that would explain the paint scraper thing. When I was getting my patch, I was so manic, I felt like I could kill god."</p>
                    <p>"Well, what the fuck am I supposed t&mdash;" Another sneeze into his elbow replaced the goop he had just shook off.</p>
                    <p>"Listen, I know a trick to make you get your patch super quick so you don't have to choke on snot for the next two weeks. C'mere."</p>
                    <p>They took his hands and squeezed them between theirs with a clap, the textured palms of their Summoning Gloves pressing divots into the backs of his hands. The pressure trapped in his skull began to melt down his spine, trickling down his arms and gathering in his palms. A concentrated heat began to bloom, and he quickly pulled his hands back in surprise, shaking them like he'd touched a hot stove.</p>
                    <p>"Emory, what the hell was th&mdash;" The pressure bolted back up to his head and teased at his balance, pinpricks congregating in the back of his throat to prompt another sneeze.</p>
                    <p>"Hey, hey! Hold on! Keep your hands together!"</p>
                    <p>They brought their hands together again, the pressure melting from his skull and the warmth building between his palms. Emory squeezed their hands tighter around his, their glowing palms searing against the back of his hands. The heat from their gloves met the fire in his palms, dancing and twisting between his metatarsals.</p>
                    <p>"Is it supposed to feel like that? It hurts!"</p>
                    <p>"Just hold on! I'm helping you, dammit! "</p>
                    <p>"It fucking burns!"</p>
                    <p>Emory was transfixed on the thin beams of light that shot from the gaps in their clasped hands. "Don't worry about the shape; it will be whatever your body wants it to be. Just think about how it feels in your hands."</p>
                    <p>"It feels like fucking fire!"</p>
                    <p>The dense heat between his palms bulged against his flesh and a deep, aching pain shot up his arms in a nauseating wave that nearly urged a gag. He whipped his hands back with a pained yelp, and a thin stick of light fell to their feet with a hollow clink. He shook out his hands as the heat dissipated, leaving a small sizzling ring in the middle of his palms, the textured grid of their gloves seared into the backs of his hands.</p>
                    <p>"God <em>dammit,</em> Emory, that fucking hurt!"</p>
                    <p>"Well, you feel better, don't you? If not, think of it as payback for chucking a paint scraper at my head, you ass."</p>
                    <p>The pressure against his skull had subsided, though his fingers were stiff and his palms still tender. It mimicked the nagging, lingering pain of freshly burnt skin. "I guess," he muttered as he bent down to pick up the featureless rectangle of pulsing blue light. It fit snugly in his palm, roughly 5 inches in length. Its warmth made his tender skin ache. He ran his thumb down the side, and its shape warped from the pressure. "Lotta fuss to make over something so...unremarkable."</p>
                    <p>"Well, maybe it's not done yet. I would've given it like another minute or so."</p>
                    <p>"If I went another minute, I think you woulda burnt a hole through my hand."</p>
                    <p>Lucia planted a hand on both their shoulders, and they jolted in surprise, having forgotten she was still there. Her face was ragged with exhaustion, and the two registered just how ridiculous and chaotic they must have looked, going from arguing to shooting light from their clasped hands within minutes. "Everything alright over here? Did you get it sorted out?"</p>
                    <p>Emory waved her off. "Yeah, yeah. All good. For now."</p>
                    <p>She brought a hand to her head with a weary sigh. "I'm gonna go back to my office and try to lower my heart rate. Please, both of you, try not to...oh, I don't even know what's going on anymore. It's been a day. Just don't kill each other. Please."</p>
                    <p>The two watched as she staggered back to her office, gripping her head as she slammed the door.</p>
                    <p>"I guess we're all having a day, huh?" Emory planted their hands on their hips. "I think something's in the air."</p>
                    <p>"I think that's just the effect you have on this store," he muttered. He had been fidgeting with the amorphous rod of light in his palm, and his thumb came to a small bump toward the top. He curiously pressed against it to feel its form, and a thin blade swung out from the side with a swish.</p>
                    <p>He stared at it in disbelief.</p>
                    <p>"Oh, it's a pocket knife." They hid a smirk behind their hand.</p>
                    <p>He continued to stare at it, as if doing so would be able to change anything. He hoped he was looking at it wrong. Its exact features were difficult to make out, but the thin blade undeniably belonged to a pocket knife, no matter how he looked at it. "All that&mdash;not to mention all the years of waiting&mdash;for a fucking pocket knife?"</p>
                    <p>"Patches are...mysterious for sure." They were having trouble hiding their amusement, both in their tone and on their face.</p>
                    <p>"Oh, you think this is funny? You forced my patch and subjected me to excruciating pain, then you have the audacity to make fun of it? It probably sucks so bad because you made me do it in one go! It was probably gonna be a cool sword o-or something, and now I'm stuck with a stupid pocket knife as a patch for the rest of my life because you just had to butt in!"</p>
                    <p>"Listen, asshole. It's not a pocket knife because of me. Your body's gonna make what your body thinks you need most when you're in the Branch Arena. What's so bad about a pocket knife anyway? They're cool! I've got like 5 of them."</p>
                    <p>"It's just that! They're so...mundane!"</p>
                    <p>"Oh, what? Were you expecting a sick ass fantasy weapon or something?"</p>
                    <p>"Kind of, yes!" The image of Gen's ornate scythe came to mind, even the thought of Rami's handaxes and Eli's dagger sounded like they belonged to a character in a TTRPG. And yes, even though Emory's bat was relatively simple in design, it suited them well and had a fantastical air about it when they wielded it. For the majority of his adult life, he had convinced himself that his body was taking so long because it was making something grand. A pocket knife wasn't even close to being on the radar of possibilities.</p>
                    <p>"Well, for whatever reason, your body thinks a pocket knife is your best bet against your Vice. I've been told to not look a gift patch in the mouth. Blade. Whatever."</p>
                    <p>He casually swung it between his thumb and forefinger, glaring at it with a wrinkled frown.</p>
                    <p>"Hey, think of it this way. You <em>really</em> would've been disappointed if you spent two weeks making that thing like you're supposed to."</p>
                    <p>He redirected his glare to point at them. Their blas&eacute; attitude was even more aggravating than usual today. "Don't you think that was a little reckless?"</p>
                    <p>They clicked their teeth in irritation. "You're the second person to call me that today."</p>
                    <p>"Shocker."</p>
                    <p>"Well, I'm not reckless, for the record. It's not like I don't think about stuff before I do it."</p>
                    <p>"I do actually find that shocking."</p>
                    <p>"Y'know, I'm used to your snarky sad boy routine by now, but I dunno why you're so cranky. I should be the cranky one."</p>
                    <p>"I can think of plenty of reasons for me to be cranky."</p>
                    <p>"Oh, really? Name one."</p>
                    <p>"Have you already forgotten that I was choking on AV earlier? Like less than 10 minutes ago? I felt like I was drowning. A-and not only that, then you practically burnt holes through my hands!"</p>
                    <p>"Whats the big deal? You got your patch, didn't you? You should be happy."</p>
                    <p>"Happy? Not a single part of that was enjoyable!"</p>
                    <p>"Who cares? It's over and done, and now you don't have to worry about it anymore. What are you so uptight about?"</p>
                    <p>He could feel frustration building in his jaw, the same frustration he felt whenever he realized arguing with them was a fool's errand, but he continued regardless. "Maybe...just maybe I'm a little miffed at the idea that you skip around subjecting everyone to your whims with complete disregard for their wellbeing."</p>
                    <p>They rolled their eyes, another brazen display of indifference that made Danny's blood boil.</p>
                    <p>"Like I said," they began in a condescending tone, "it's not like I'm not thinking about stuff. I just figured you'd rather having a little short term pain instead of dragging it out for 2 weeks, so sue me."</p>
                    <p>"That!" he declared, jabbing his pointed finger into their shoulder. "That's the shit I'm talking about. It's not that you don't think about it; it's that you don't <em>care</em>."</p>
                    <p>"And how the hell do you know what I care about?"</p>
                    <p>"Because you tell everyone, Emory! You just ratted yourself out! You don't care that it was excruciating, you just want to brag about helping me get my patch! You don't care <em>how</em> Branches are addressed, so long as you can brag about how many Branches you've stopped! You don't care if you hurt people in the process, so long as you can brag about your accomplishments!"</p>
                    <p>They drilled a sternly pointed finger into his chest. "I will <em>not</em> let you make me feel bad for trying to help people!"</p>
                    <p>"How do you even know that's what you did? Who even knows what happened to all those people you assaulted because you had your little vigilante agenda!"</p>
                    <p>"Real classy, Danny. As if I haven't already had my ass handed to me today. I fucking get it! I fucked up! But you will <em>not</em> judge me based on my motives! I...was trying...to help!" They bared their teeth with a snarl, jagged incisors catching the overhead light with a glint. A whiff of smoke seeped from their grit teeth.</p>
                    <p>"That's just it; I can't wrap my head around how you actually thought going around incapacitating people with a baseball bat was a net positive on society!"</p>
                    <p>"What are you even yelling about anymore? I've already been chewed out; what more do you want?"</p>
                    <p>"I wanna know where you get off on thinking you're everyone's savior! What the hell makes you think you're qualified to be acting like this? You're not some fucking Vice expert; in fact, if anyone here's a Vice expert, it should be me!"</p>
                    <p>"Oh, way to turn it all back to you, like you always do! You're insufferable! Do you fucking hear yourself? You truly think you're the pinnacle of suffering, don't you?"</p>
                    <p>"Comparatively speaking, yes!"</p>
                    <p>Emory pulled back in bewilderment, the edge of their their mouth twitching into an incredulous, wild grin. They slowly shook their head, their grin growing wider. "I never thought you'd actually admit it. You really, truly think you've got it the worst, huh?"</p>
                    <p>"Emory, my Vice is so fucked up, they don't even know how to classify it, okay? I'd give anything to be dealing with something they understand. Something I can actually read and talk about, and not feel like it's standing over my shoulder. Something fucking tangible, something known! I'd give anything to just have an Alpha Vice!"</p>
                    <p>"So...mine. You're one step away from admitting you wish you had my Vice. You're a real piece of work, Danny, you know that? An insufferable, selfish, ignorant piece of work." Emory grabbed at his shirt and pinned him back against the counter as their chest hitched. "You have no idea how terrifying the common Vice is. But you're going to find out."</p>
                    <p>A wave of pressure burst from their feet as shivers broke out across their shoulders. Tall, pointed horns sprouted from the top of their skull as smoke curled into the dense gray cloud suspended above them. It smelled of a bonfire with the sweet, earthy aroma of burning oak. A thin rim of amber lined their blown pupils, and jagged incisors pushed up their lips as they continued shouting. Something about pushing, instigating, forcing their hand. How whatever happened, he deserved it.</p>
                    <p>A wave of fear washed over Danny as he watched their horns tear through their scalp, blood trickling down their forehead. He dug around in his pocket for his phone, and his hand trembled as his mind reeled, desperately trying to remember the code to send Rami. <em>I can't do this alone</em>.</p>
                    <p>A high pitched ringing tore through his ears, and a nauseating thud in his chest nearly made his legs give out. His grip on his phone was compromised, and the tremors of fear jerked his thumb around the screen. <em>I can't do this at all</em>. With a tap, his phone fell to the floor, and he brought his trembling hand back to push them away, to no avail. Their knuckles dug into his chest, and right as it began, his palm was pressed against their shoulder.</p>
                    <p>A force pulled him toward Emory, a sensation much stronger than he had ever felt before. It was as if his consciousness was being siphoned out of him, drawn to the black hole standing before him. He could feel his palms melting past their jacket, their skin, their muscles.</p>

                            <p>Danny's palms gently cupped their shoulders, his fingers loosening as he spaced out. Emory carried on with their rant, desperately gripping his shirt.</p>

                            <p>The floor disappeared beneath his feet, revealing a gaping void below. He was alone, directionless, surrounded by a pitch so dark and empty that his eyes began to play tricks on him by filling the nothingness with vague shadows and swirling forms. He squeezed his eyes shut and watched the phosphenes dance behind his eyelids; he listened to his arteries push blood through his ears. Soon, the phosephenes morphed into grotesque faces, and the sound of his rushing blood began to resemble sharp whispers. There was nothing to ground him as his senses ran wild trying to fill the silence. The sound of his breaths, his blood, his joints, his tendons, they twisted among each other to create a visceral cacophony of creaks and thuds. A pressure began building deep in his ears and pressed against his temples, eliciting a high-pitched whine that pierced through the discord. A heavy thud resonated from his chest and shook his ribs as his feet finally came to rest on solid ground.</p>

                            <p>Danny tightened his grip around their shoulders as Emory's once-tense limbs limply fell to their side with a puff of smoke from their lips, their tirade coming to an end.</p>

                            <p>He opened his eyes to a thin beam of warm light about 20 feet in front of him, obscured by a densely packed row of mechanical shapes. He was seated, with his knees to his chest, on what felt like warm, smooth concrete. The faint aromas of gasoline, lumber, and freshly-cut grass hung in the air. His parched senses guzzled the details of his surroundings, and as his eyes began to adjust, he could see he was in a garage, packed full with equipment. Brooms, shovels, and rakes were precariously propped against a dusty lawnmower, plastic buckets and cardboard boxes packed into the far right corner. Rusted bikes with broken chains and a scuffed ladder with cracked plastic leaned against the wall. Various sports paraphernalia were strewn across the garage, deflated basketballs and worn-out cleats tucked into hard-to-reach places. An aisle just big enough for a truck separated the piles of clutter from an equally cluttered workbench. As he began to cautiously unfurl, a gloved hand sternly brought him back down.</p>

                        <div class="metaphysical">
                            <p>"Stay down," Emory whispered sharply, perched to his left. "Do you know where you are?"</p>
                            <p>"Um..." his voice trembled. "A garage?"</p>
                            <p>"Well, yeah. But this is a Branch. My Branch. So thanks a lot."</p>
                            <p>"Br&mdash;what do you mean?"</p>
                            <p>"I <em>mean</em>, if you weren't such an ass earlier, this probably wouldn't have happened."</p>
                            <p>"N-no, I mean...is this really a Branch?"</p>
                            <p>"No, we just magically transported to my childhood garage."</p>
                            <p>"And wh&mdash;wait, excuse me! You intentionally brought me in to this!"</p>
                            <p>"Well, yeah, but you instigated it. Thought it was only fair." They shrugged casually. "This all could've been avoided if you didn't have such a complex."</p>
                            <p>"I-I can't do this; I can't have you being so fucking <em>relaxed</em> about this! I've never been an Adjunct before!"</p>
                            <p>"Hey, if&mdash;wait, seriously?" Emory scowled at him as he sheepishly shook his head. "You made that whole insufferable speech earlier, and you've never actually experienced someone else's Branch? God, you're worse than I thought. Maybe getting gnawed on like a chew toy in here will do you some good."</p>
                            <p>"I do feel like I'm going to throw up if that's any consolation."</p>
                            <p>"It's not. And listen, if anyone's got the short end of the stick here, it's me. If things go south for you, you get ejected and leave with a few broken bones, probably some internal bleeding. If things go south for me, I fucking die, so. Get some perspective."</p>
                            <p>"W-w-why are you talking about things going south? Haven't you done this a million times?"</p>
                            <p>"Vices are complicated, Danny. You of all people should know that. Other people can have complicated Vices, too, in case you need me to drill that in your head."</p>
                            <p>"You didn't let me finish earlier, I&mdash;"</p>
                            <p>They tapped the nonexistent watch around their wrist. "I don't have time for one of your monologues. It's a race against the clock in here, as I'm sure you're wildly aware. Every second I spend talking to you in here, my Vice has probably grown, what, a millimeter?"</p>
                            <p>"I don't think it's that fast," he gulped.</p>
                            <p>Emory tipped their head back with a sigh. "I'm thinking about throwing you outside and waiting it out in here until you get chewed to bits."</p>
                            <p>"Y-you keep saying chewed. What, um...what does its exhibition look like?"</p>
                            <p>"It's like a, uh...a wolf-dog panther thing. Big teeth, hence the chewing. Size of a truck. Can't miss it."</p>
                            <p>"Oh my god."</p>
                            <p>"Alright, I need to get started. Stay outta my way, but I want you watching the whole thing. Maybe you'll think twice before you say some dumb shit again. Do some deep breathing or something while I'm gone, &lsquo;cause if it senses any fear from you, it'll hunt you down and tear you to shreds."<span class="tooltip" tabindex="1"><span class="fa-solid fa-circle-info"></span><span class="tooltip__hover"><img src="./images/toshredsyousay.webp" alt="a screenshot of Professor Farnsworth from Futurama with a bold text overlay that reads: to shreds you say"></span></span></p>
                            <p>"Are you kidding me? What the fuck do you expect me to do if it attacks me? Party tricks with my stupid fucking pocket knife?"</p>
                            <p>"It's <em>fine</em>, okay? It probably won't even attack you, because it'll be focused on me. I usually have Rami to help, but I've done it by myself before. Just...hide back here in the corner, and it should leave you alone."</p>
                            <p>"Should?"</p>
                            <p>"Well, I can't say for sure; it's basically an animal so it'll do whatever it wants."</p>
                            <p>"Very reassuring."</p>
                            <p>"Again. I'm begging you to get some perspective here."</p>

                            <p>The Vice core sat tucked underneath Emory's shoulder blade, adhering to their scapula with writhing, fibrous tendrils that began spreading and branching across their muscles. Their horns continued to stretch above them, drenching their scalp in blood.</p>
                        </div>
                        <div class="metaphysical">
                            <p>Emory rose to their feet with clenched fists and side-stepped out from behind the barricade of equipment. They advanced down the aisle to the garage door, their heavy boots thudding against the concrete. Danny stayed crouched as his breath rattled in his chest, apprehensively peeking out above the handle of a rusted push mower. They stood at the door, feet spread wide in a power stance. With a long breath in and a quick exhale, Emory threw the door open. Metal rattled and pierced through the dense silence, revealing an empty driveway illuminated by the security light above the garage door.</p>
                            <p>"Alright! Where are ya?" Emory declared as they snapped the worn hems of their gloves. They lifted their open hand as a beam of bright cyan shot upward and exploded into a fine mist, leaving behind a baseball bat in their grip. The bat, this time, was fully formed with painstaking details. The barrel was metal, dented and scraped in many places, the rubber grip tattered and torn from repeated use. The faded, blocky, black logo along the barrel suggested this patch mimicked a keepsake of Emory's, something they knew well.</p>
                            <p>"God, I'm so sick of these stupid little games of yours," they groaned as they twirled their bat around carelessly. "I know you like to hide, but why don't you just come on out so we can get this over with?" They meandered down the driveway, lumbering from side to side as they scanned the darkness.</p>
                            <p>The security light washed the arena in a warm, soft light, giving Emory a long shadow as they approached the right bend in the driveway. Patches of burnt grass filled the rest of the arena, and scraggly bushes lined the garage. Two bare trees punctuated the driveway, looming overhead and suffocating the uncharacteristically small Branch Arena. The light only extended so far, and a palpable darkness engulfed the perimeter of the arena.</p>
                            <p>Emory reached the end of the driveway with a huff. "You should really put another light in here next time. I can't see shit!" They squinted out into the darkness, trying to lock on to any moving shadows.</p>
                            <p>Not having an eye on Emory made Danny's stomach churn, but he stayed glued to the floor. He couldn't shake the feeling of being watched, then he realized that was because it was, in fact, his reality. Somewhere in this Branch Arena was a wild, disgusting beast waiting to pounce. Even with Emory's hint of it being a wolf-dog panther with big teeth, what it looked like and how it moved was outside of his realm of imagination, having only ever encountered his Vice's exhibition a handful of times. And that was nowhere near similar to a wolf-dog panther.</p>
                            <p>The longer Emory meandered outside the garage without any action, the faster his heart raced. With each passing moment, he knew their Vice was expanding and writhing inside them. The image made the hair on his neck stand on-end, or perhaps it was because he sensed movement around him.</p>
                            <p>He searched for a glint, a pair of focused eyes in the darkness. His fluttering heart sent shivers down his spine, so he retreated back to the corner to calm his erratic heartbeat. He felt somewhat safe with his back to the wall and backed into the corner, despite the fact it provided him no exit route. The rows of equipment between him and the end of the garage felt enough like a barrier between him and the unknown, and the small ditch he was backed into was barely large enough to fit him, so it likely couldn't fit their Vice's exhibition. He hoped. He squeezed his eyes shut and held his head in his hands as he exhaled a long, gravelly groan. No amount of deep breathing would do him any good with how quickly his mind was reeling, regret and shame fueling its obsessive cycles.</p>

                            <p>Danny's heart began to race, and his fingertips dug into their shoulder, slipping against the slick fabric of their jacket. His phone vibrated at his feet.</p>
                        </div>
                        <div class="metaphysical">
                            <p>A subtle clicking noise. A whiff of gasoline fumes.</p>
                            <p>He slowly opened his eyes and suppressed a gasp as a hulking black mass stood before him at the end of the barricade, facing him with a devious, fang-bearing grin. What Emory failed to mention about its teeth was that they dominated the surface area of its large, dense head, and a single tooth was practically the length of his forearm. Short, pitch black fur ran the entirety of its top-heavy body, stopping at the leathery tail that eagerly whipped from side to side. Large, pointed horns extruded from the sockets where its eyes should've been. Where Danny had assumed it was the size of a modest pickup truck, it was closer to the size of a lifted dually that belonged to a city boy with a complex.</p>
                            <p>It crouched low to the floor, its dense fur parting in tufts as its thick hide warped around its jutting bones. Danny's back was pressed flat against the wall, and he swore his racing heart was rattling the sheets of plywood behind him. The Branch Arena was small, and Emory would notice soon, but what would happen in the interim? What he was seeing was no more real than a dream&mdash;albeit with consequences&mdash;but the visceral fear of staring certain death in the face flowed through his body all the same.</p>
                            <p>It lunged toward him, and Danny's heart sank to his stomach as he curled into a tight ball to shield his head. A clamor rang out as the beast fought against the barricade of equipment, its large body too bulky and its arms too short to reach him through the layers of landscaping tools and buckets. Ragged, ivory claws tore through the air with a whip as it snarled, smoke seeping from between its teeth. He pinned himself against the wall as flat as he could, splinters from the sheets of plywood digging into his back.</p>
                            <p>He dragged the push mower out to shield him, but its claws scraped and dented its compromised frame. With the gap in the barricade, it forced its way closer to him, its feverishly swiping claws now barely grazing the tip of his nose. He pushed his feet against the mower to try to push it back, but it crunched under the weight of its frenzied, thrashing body.</p>

                            <p>Emory's body had tensed, their jaw clamped shut and teeth clenched. Danny's hands trembled as his fingers dug into their shoulder.</p>

                        <div class="metaphysical">
                            <p>To his dismay, Emory was having trouble getting a foothold on the situation. The beast's tail was thrashing wildly, blocking the majority of their attempts at inflicting any meaningful damage with their bat. They were clearly growing more frustrated by the second. "Turn around, you mangy mutt! It's me you want!"</p>
                            <p>"I'm pretty sure it actually wants me!" his voice shook as he made futile attempts to dodge the flailing claws before him. They nicked and scraped at his face, some deeper than others, his skin a canvas of red gashes.</p>
                            <p>"It's not all about you, Danny!"</p>
                            <p>A jagged claw ensnared itself in his tangled hair, yanking him forward and bashing his head against the rusted metal of the push mower. Chunks of rusted metal grated against his cheek, and he could hear his hair being ripped from its roots.</p>
                            <p>He spat a string of expletives, struggling to untangle its claw as it violently thrashed about, swatting at him with its other paw.</p>
                            <p>"God dammit, look at me, you stupid fucking dog!" Emory howled, relentlessly bashing the barrel of their bat against its hind legs. "It needs to know you can fight back, Danny!"</p>
                            <p>"With what?"</p>
                            <p>"Your stupid pocket knife!"</p>
                            <p>"What the hell is that going to do?"</p>
                            <p>"It's gonna tell it you've got at least <em>some</em> way to fight back!"</p>
                            <p>"That's not even going to faze it!"</p>
                            <p>"Trust me! Just make it count! It should be on your person since it was already out when you were brought in!"</p>
                            <p>He tugged back at his hair to relieve the stabbing tension as he patted around his person, though in doing so, it allowed the beast to rake its claws down his arm, flaying his skin and tearing through his tendons. He whipped his arm back, painting his body with the blood gushing from the gash. He cried out in agony, the pain so overwhelming it was nauseating.</p>

                            <p>A thin slit ran down Danny's forearm, parting his skin. Blood oozed and congealed into taut, red beads. The cut deepened, and his skin parted, stretching syrupy strings of blood between the flayed skin.</p>
                        </div>
                        <div class="metaphysical">
                            <p>Regret ripped through Emory's chest as Danny's tormented wail pierced their eardrums. They wanted to say this level of torture was never their intention, but deep down they knew they wanted him to see just how threatening their Vice could be. They wanted him to experience even just a fraction of the fear that had paralyzed them in their first Branch. <em>Good</em>, they caught themself thinking, and it made them furious.</p>
                            <p>They tossed their bat to the side, and in a fit of rage, they sank their teeth into its thick, leathery tail to tear a chunk from its flesh. It pulled back with a yelp, dragging Danny forward by the hair to stumble to his knees. The knife fell from his shirt pocket and clattered against the concrete.</p>
                            <p>His hand was weak, trembling with a deep, throbbing pain as every movement sheared his gaping wound and urged fresh blood to wash away the tacky clots. He clenched his fist around the knife and flipped out the blade, his flexed tendons urging spurts of blood, then brought it to the claw entangled in his hair.</p>
                            <p>He sawed at the cuticle, the blade slicing through its hide until it met resistance at the bone. The beast retaliated with a screech, swinging its other paw to embed its talons in the tensed flesh of his shoulder. "Damn you!" he cried, tightening his grip around the knife. "You stupid fucking dog!" He brought the blade down with a crack, severing its claw and freeing him from its grasp.</p>
                            <p>The beast reared back with lament, its deep, guttural cry echoing throughout the arena.</p>
                            <p>"Oh, fuck yeah!" Emory exclaimed, establishing their grip on the base of its tail by digging their nails into its flesh. As the beast flailed in pain, it allowed them to drag it from the garage, whipping it by its tail and flinging it down the driveway to skid across the concrete. Danny was frozen against the wall, the blade of his pocket knife catching light as it shook in his trembling grip.</p>

                            <p>Emory's fists were clenched so tightly they began to shake. Puffs of smoke billowed from their nostrils with each sharp, staggered breath. Their incisors nicked against their lips as the rest of their teeth began to sharpen.</p>
                        </div>
                        <div class="metaphysical">
                            <p>The metal barrel of the bat echoed throughout the Branch Arena as Emory dragged it across the concrete. Its chime almost resembled the bell rung before a boxing match, announcing the beginnings of a brawl.</p>
                            <p>The beast clambered to its feet with a defiant roar, and Emory widened their stance with a smirk, tightening their fist around the rubber grip of their bat. "C'mon. Let's do this right."</p>
                            <p>It bounded toward them, fangs bared and smoke streaming behind it. Emory planted their feet and readied their bat over their shoulder. Its fangs glinted in the low light of the security lamp as it pounced, mouth split wide. They swung their bat at lightning speed, the barrel crunching against its thick skull.</p>
                            <p>Emory oozed confidence with every swing, their cocky grin stretching to a rapturous display of manic audacity. They were almost laughing with each hit, completely unfazed by the teeth and claws that occasionally tore through their skin. They truly seemed to be in their element, backing the beast into the corner of the driveway with each swing. Danny felt a flutter of hope in his bleeding chest, but he quickly tamped down the feeling, knowing better than to let it get out of hand.</p>
                            <p>"Persistent!" Emory announced with a huff, flicking sweat from their brow. "Damn thing's making me work for it!" They attempted a humorous tone, but struggled to hide the surprise in their voice.</p>
                            <p>It occurred to Danny that their patch might not have been the best counter, what with their Vice's thick hide and muscular build. Sure, it cracked bones on contact, but it only dealt damage at the expense of their energy, and a piercing weapon seemed much more efficient in theory. That flutter of hope soon became a pang of anxiety. He suddenly doubted their progress and realized that their spirited expressions were not made in rapture, but to mask their growing fear.</p>
                            <p>Over time, their swings became less confident; they began to hesitate, to stagger. The beast began to emerge from its corner, each swipe of its claws pushing Emory back to the center of the arena. Sparks flew as it dragged its claws down the barrel, chipping off metal shavings. It hovered around the edge of darkness, seeping into the void to hunt, then lunging out into the light to attack.</p>
                            <p>Danny wanted to say something supportive; it felt like the right thing to do given the circumstances, but he knew nothing he said would have actually helped lift their spirits. If anything, they probably would've seen it as patronizing. Emory was a self-sufficient creature, after all, so they didn't stay down for long. They planted their feet and readied their bat over their shoulder once more, exhaling a quick, focused breath with a scowl.</p>
                        </div>

                            <p>The Vice core had expanded to wrap around their scapula and began creeping up their spine. Fleshy tendrils seeped between the intervertebral foramen and snaked along the divots of their vertebrae. The piercing wails of the fire alarm made Danny's eardrums tense.</p>
                        </div>
                        <div class="metaphysical">
                            <p>Emory swung their bat, the barrel making direct contact with its temple as a crack echoed throughout the arena. A burst of euphoria erupted from their chest as they took another swing. Another crack. But the beast stayed standing, sturdy as ever.</p>
                            <p>They lowered their bat to their side, their breaths ragged. Its grip felt brittle in their palm, sloughing off flakes of rubber and metal. A long, cyan slit ran down the barrel, leaking a thin beam of light out into the darkness around them. Their heart sank, a cold sweat breaking out down their neck and pinpricks of fear engulfing their forearms.</p>
                            <p>It was just a patch. It could be repaired with rest and patience. But it had never failed them, not once in the over 20 Branch Arenas they wielded it nor for the countless suspensions. And for the first time in their life, Emory wondered if their patch was actually not well-suited for their Vice. Without a blade to pierce through its hide, it would take hours to inflict meaningful damage. But they had done this before. Why wasn't it working now?</p>
                            <p>Danny's chest hitched. "Em&mdash;!"</p>
                            <p>The beast slammed its paw against their head, its claws puncturing their temples. Emory was thrown down, and their shoulder hit the concrete with a crack.</p>
                        </div>
                    </div>

                            <p>Danny's palms felt a sudden zap, sending a bolt of static up his arms. Emory's muscles tensed. Hurried footsteps approached. A warm hand slapped against their back, and another came to rest on Danny's shoulder.</p>
                        </div>
                        <div class="metaphysical">
                            <p>Emory's shoulder snapped back into place as the beast pinned them against the concrete, its claws digging into their collarbone. It exhaled a hot, eager breath that rolled over their face and reeked of gasoline. A string of saliva dripped from its bared fangs. Emory writhed beneath its grip, grunting and kicking and cursing and scratching. Danny stood at the edge of the garage, paralyzed with fear.</p>
                            <p>A loud clap split through the arena as sparks fell from above. The beast whipped its head up, tilting it it to the side as it watched the sparks rain down toward the end of the driveway. Emory lunged upright and sunk their teeth into the beast's leg, then rammed their foot into its stomach. It reared back with a shriek, and they quickly scrambled out from beneath it before its paws came back down with a slam.</p>
                            <p>A distant exclamation announced the arrival of a new Adjunct, the sound of their voice gradually growing louder. They were yelling as they fell from above, punctuating their cry with a very pointed, "Incoming!". Twigs snapped and branches cracked as they came tumbling down through one of the trees like a puck in a plinko board, and they were spit out in the grass with a dense thud.</p>
                            <p>The two came to recognize the barely-responsive body draped in a torn lab coat and covered in leaves as Rami, who weakly raised a thumbs up and declared, face smushed against the grass, "I'm okay!"</p>
                            <p>The beast let out a defiant roar, and a metallic glint suddenly whizzed through the air at lightning speed. Before either could process it, a small axe had been launched across the arena and lodged squarely in the forehead of the beast. It staggered back with a whine, pawing at the blade splitting its skull.</p>
                        </div>
                    </div>
                    <div class="prod">
                        <div class="corporeal">
                            <p>Rami wrapped his arms around the two of them, bringing them in for a tight hug against his chest.</p>
                        </div>
                        <div class="metaphysical">
                            <p>Rami leapt to his feet and dusted the leaves from his coat with a whistle. "I've never been all that good at using those."</p>
                            <p>Emory gave him a hearty slap on the back. "Leave it to my primary Adjunct to know just when I need him, huh?"</p>
                            <p>He beamed as he coyly scratched his beard. "Can't take all the credit! It was Danny who actually alerted me. What I will take credit for is running down the street at top speed. I haven't done that in a while. Oh, speaking of Danny, where&mdash;"</p>
                            <p>He caught sight of Danny, frozen and bloodied at the edge of the garage. He scrunched his face into a pitying, toothy smile as he eyed the bare tendons jutting out of the gash in his arm. "G-Good lookin' out! Uh...hang in there!"</p>
                            <p>He weakly raised a thumbs up, blood spurting from his wound.</p>
                            <p>"So, get me up to speed." Rami held out his hand as a beam of cyan burst from his palm. The light faded, leaving behind a second small handaxe in his grasp.</p>
                            <p>"Well, for starters. My patch is busted," Emory groaned, gingerly holding it by its disintegrating grip. "I'll probably only be able to use it once or twice before it snaps. So I'm counting on you to be really <em>really</em> precise."</p>
                            <p>"Oh, that's..." He looked over as the beast pried the handaxe from its forehead. "Hm, no pressure, huh?"</p>
                            <p>"Yes pressure! I need you in full Floor Manager mode." They brought their hand to their forehead in a stiff salute.</p>
                            <p>He casually spun the axe around as the beast bolted toward them. "Kind of offended you think I'm ever not." He suddenly dug his heel into the ground and whipped the axe toward the beast, blasting it backwards to land belly-up, its legs scrambling in the air like an overturned beetle.</p>
                            <p>"What're you thinkin', then? Hammer and Nail would be kind of risky since my patch is busted. Maybe Sushi?"</p>
                            <p>He wiggled his fingers as he mused aloud, "I wanna conserve your patch as much as possible, so I was thinking something more like...Cowboy, given the circumstances." Both axes vanished with a flash of light and reappeared clenched in his fists. "Sound good?"</p>
                            <p>Emory's eyes lit up. "Oh, hell yeah! Let's do this!"</p>
                        </div>
                    </div>
                    <div class="prod">
                        <div class="corporeal">
                            <p>Rami pressed his hand between Emory's shoulder blades, his palm warming their skin.</p>
                        </div>
                        <div class="metaphysical">
                            <p>Emory and Rami grasped hands with a loud clap, giving each other a confident nod as the beast scrambled back to its feet. They broke from their huddle, Rami backing up with a trot and Emory bolting in a wide arc around the beast. It struggled to follow both, trying to decide who was the bigger threat. Rami whipped his axes around with a jaunty whistle as Emory threw their bat to the side. That was enough for it to lock on to Rami as Emory circled around behind it.</p>
                            <p>The beast crouched low to the ground, licking its teeth expectantly as it tensed its muscles to jump. While it was focused on Rami, Emory leapt onto its back, gripping its tufts of fur as they scrambled across its spine. It shook and bucked and kicked, flipping its dense head around wildly, unable to reach them.</p>
                            <p>Emory muttered a string of curses as they struggled to crawl to the top of its frantically thrashing head. They grabbed around its horns and pulled back, forcing its mouth open. Digging their heel into the back of its neck as an anchor to pull back further, its teeth parted and smoke spilled from between its teeth. "Now, Rami!"</p>
                            <p>The metal of the axe's blade reflected the warm glow of the security light as it whizzed across the arena. Emory yanked its horns back and its jaw unhinged with a crack. The axe sliced through the back of its throat, flaying its flesh and burrowing into the dense muscles behind it. After a bright flash of light from the back of its mouth, the second axe flew across the arena and the first returned to his grip. The second axe deepened its gaping wound, burrowing deep in the muscle fibers of its tense shoulder blades.</p>
                            <p>Emory let out a whoop as they yanked its head back, tearing at the corners of its mouth. "End it, Rami!"</p>
                            <p>He took in a sharp breath and exhaled through his nose as he summoned his axe back to his hand. The axe whipped across the arena and tore through its flesh, meeting the pulsing black tumor embedded in its muscles. The blade sliced through its thick, tacky exterior and fazed through its core like a hot knife through butter.</p>
                            <p>A deafening crack resounded throughout the arena, and a low rumbling vibrated beneath their feet. It sounded like the rush of blood pulsing through ears, a trembling eardrum, a steady heartbeat. Everyone's hearts dropped with a heavy thud and they fell to their knees, fazing through the floor beneath them.</p>
                        </div>
                    </div>
                    <p>The force of the commit nearly knocked Danny backwards. He teetered precariously on his heels as his wits came about him before Rami yanked him back into place. Emory's head tipped back and their knees gave out, and the two quickly clambered to grab them before they fell to the floor. Rami exhaled a relieved sigh as he threw their limp arm around his shoulder. He attempted to lighten the mood with a joke, but Danny couldn't hear it over the incessant blaring of the fire alarm.</p>
                    <p>Lucia threw her door open with a slam, gripping her head with a weary scowl that begged for an explanation. Rami straightened, hoisting an unconscious Emory up with him. He flashed his CVRS badge with an apologetic grin. "All good here."</p>
