        <h1><span class="superhead">1.1.0</span>Arrangements</h1>
        <p>Danny wanted nothing more than to stay home and rot, but by 6 a.m., he found himself shuffling through his dimly lit kitchen, propelled by routine and guided by muscle memory. He continued to ignore the persistent, miserable weight of exhaustion pulling at his joints and waded through the thick slurry of depression to grab himself a granola bar. A light ringing in his ears stoked the smoldering remains of a migraine.</p>
<p>Any rational person would call in from work, but the thought never crossed his mind, at least not as something he was &ldquo;allowed&rdquo; to do. Lawrence would have absolutely let him stay home, but Danny never registered it as an option to even ask. He needed money, and the only way he had to get said money was by going to work; it was as simple as that.</p>
<p>Part of him knew that rotting alone in his room wasn&rsquo;t going to make him feel better anyway. Spending hours under a blanket and letting his symptoms run with reckless abandon would only serve to perpetuate the cycle. Piles of laundry covered two thirds of the couch, and dishes crowded the dishwasher, leaving no room for the ones he had left to &ldquo;soak&rdquo;. Half of the lightbulbs in his living room were out, and his drooping pothos plant shed another shriveled leaf, adding to the ring of detritus around the base of its ceramic pot. His living quarters were more akin to a rotting den, so going to work&mdash;despite it all&mdash;was the best option on the table.</p>
<p>That is, of course, until he walked through the doors to see Lawrence chatting with Emory. His headache returned with a vengeance.</p>
<p>Emory looked over their shoulder with a smile that immediately fell to a disgusted grimace. &ldquo;Christ alive, man. You look like shit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lawrence lightly batted Emory&rsquo;s arm. &ldquo;Hey. Be nice to my favorite employee. I&rsquo;m lucky he&rsquo;s even in today.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not being mean, I&rsquo;m stating facts! Why&rsquo;d you even come in? I didn&rsquo;t expect you to be here after all that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m here,&rdquo; he grumbled as he squeezed behind the counter.</p>
<p>Emory leaned toward Lawrence, whispering behind their hand. &ldquo;Geez, don&rsquo;t you let your employees take sick time?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know I do,&rdquo; Lawrence rolled his eyes. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s a stubborn one, though. Have you ever tried to convince him to do anything?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All the time. He&rsquo;s easy to push around.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me rephrase. Have you ever convinced him to do something good for himself?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah. Never.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Danny punched the register closed with a loud chime to remind them he was within hearing distance.</p>
<p>Emory dismissed him with a wave of their hand. &ldquo;Anyway, Lawrence. Glad to hear things have been quiet since last night. I gave you the CVRS card, but here&rsquo;s my number if you ever need me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Much appreciated. CVRS hasn&rsquo;t done much for me in the past, anyway. I&rsquo;d rather call you before them anytime.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Lawrence,&rdquo; Emory bashfully turned away. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll hang around today to make sure nothing else pops up, just for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Danny called out from the counter, &ldquo;Quit acting like you&rsquo;re doing this out of the goodness of your heart.&rdquo; He pointed at Lawrence with a raised brow. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re just using you for your hot chips.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I know,&rdquo; Lawrence patted Emory&rsquo;s shoulder with an amused smirk. &ldquo;But I do feel a bit more at ease with you around, and peace of mind is worth a couple bags of hot chips. Help yourself to some, by all means. I&rsquo;ll be in the back if you need me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Emory flashed Danny a smug grin, then scurried off to the hot chips endcap. He could hear rustling as they stuffed their jacket pockets full. &ldquo;Hey Danny, think fast!&rdquo; They jumped out from behind the endcap to launch a chip bag at lightning speed directly for his head.</p>
<p>He slapped the bag away with an exhausted sigh. Emory smiled weakly and awkwardly gestured to the chip bag, now laying on the floor. &ldquo;Y&rsquo;know&hellip;as thanks or whatever. For helpin&rsquo; out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So thoughtful,&rdquo; he grunted as he picked it up off the floor. Emory nervously drummed their fingers as he tore the bag open. He fished around for the chips with the most dust and narrowed his eyes at Emory. &ldquo;Do you need something?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Emory averted eye contact and sheepishly pursed their lips. &ldquo;I, uh, I do appreciate your help n&rsquo; all, actually.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can tell by the hot chips you so graciously threw at me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I tend to&hellip;you know&hellip;get caught up in it all, sometimes. It&rsquo;s exhilarating.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad you get a kick out of it,&rdquo; he grumbled through half-chewed chips.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I, well&hellip;I forget it has that effect on you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you just not listen when I talk?&rdquo; he threw his hands up with a scoff. &ldquo;I said that at least three times yesterday. And probably a million before that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t really listen to anyone, if that makes you feel better.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It really doesn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I do wanna make it up to you! I&rsquo;ll try my best to not get you &lsquo;looped in&rsquo; to any more of my &lsquo;shenanigans&rsquo;. But in the meantime, why don&rsquo;t we all go get ramen or something? My treat?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Danny squinted suspiciously. &ldquo;Did Rami put you up to this? Or Gen?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Both, technically. But I ignored them, and now I&rsquo;m doing this because I feel bad. You really do look awful.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Has anyone ever told you that you&rsquo;re bad at apologies?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let ramen fill the void where my words have failed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t fucking stand you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Be that as it may, Danny still couldn&rsquo;t resist the alluring siren call of ramen. His eye-roll followed by a shrug told Emory that he reluctantly agreed to the arrangement, despite his better judgment, so they flashed a satisfied grin and hopped away to inspect the scene of the crime from the night before.</p>
<p>Ramen was known to be Danny&rsquo;s meal of choice when he didn&rsquo;t feel well, but knowing he would likely get grilled by Gen or Rami, he wasn&rsquo;t sure if he would actually leave feeling any better. Though, if he declined a ramen outing, Gen and Rami would&rsquo;ve likely shown up at his door anyway.</p>
<p>His relationship with Rami&ndash;and especially Gen&ndash;often teetered on a bizarre tightrope between &ldquo;best friend&rdquo; and &ldquo;trusted medical professional&rdquo;. While Rami was often more concerned with corralling Emory, Danny knew that he was always under the quiet, watchful eye of Gen. It was unavoidable, he figured, due to her morbid fascination with vicology since their middle school days. One big incident and suddenly their relationship went from two edgy teens against the world to a scientist and her research subject against the world.</p>
<p>Every &ldquo;how are you feeling&rdquo; had an air of couch psychiatrist to it that Danny couldn&rsquo;t ignore. He knew deep in his heart that Gen cared about him and wanted him to thrive, but lately every interaction felt like she was gathering data. He wasn&rsquo;t sure if it was because he was getting steadily worse and that was her way of caring, or because Gen was stuck in some vicological research rabbit hole, and he happened to be the perfect subject.</p>
<p>Regardless, he began steeling himself for the inevitable interrogation. He could already feel his patience wearing thin as he watched Emory sniff around the endcap where the Host was Suspended. As in, they were literally on their knees sniffing floor tiles.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what helpful smells you think you&rsquo;re going to find over there,&rdquo; Danny began with a sigh, &ldquo;but good luck deciphering anything. All I can ever smell is the Trademark Funk of these rancid floor tiles.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, you smell that, too? I was trying to figure out where it was coming from.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s probably just a rat carcass stuck under one of the display cases. If it gets any worse I&rsquo;ll call pest control. Now get off the floor. God forbid we ever have a customer come in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t you watched any horror movies? The smell of rot always precedes&hellip;uh&hellip;I dunno, ghosts and shit? Bad stuff, in my experience.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We live in Texas. If it&rsquo;s not a rat, it&rsquo;s probably a racoon. Or an armadillo. Or an opossum. Or a bird. I&rsquo;d list off all the native animals of Texas before I ever considered it being a ghost.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Emory ignored him as they hopped to their feet. They scratched their chin as they mused aloud. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not really rot, though, is it? I know what dead animals smell like, and this really isn&rsquo;t that. I can&rsquo;t quite put my finger on it. It&rsquo;s definitely funky, but I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s a dead animal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know why you&rsquo;re trying to get to that bottom of that, of all things. This building is at least 60 years old. God knows what&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s embedded in the floor tiles. Well, I mean&hellip;I know. I had to clean them just last week. It&rsquo;s nothing supernatural, I&rsquo;ll tell you that. Horrific, sure. Supernatural, no.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Emory shifted their musings to private grumblings and began pacing up and down the aisles. They pulled a rolled collection of papers from the inner pocket of their utility jacket.</p>
<p>Danny rolled his eyes at the sight of the tattered CVRS manual. &ldquo;Oh, come on. You&rsquo;ve got to quit playing Target Hunter, Emory.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s what Lawrence is paying me to do. Might as well cover all my bases.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s not paying you. He&rsquo;s letting you hang around and eat chips because he knows you got nothing better to do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Y&rsquo;know, Danny,&rdquo; Emory hummed as they scanned the crumpled pages. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re kind of a dick.&rdquo; Before he could retort, they continued, &ldquo;But you heard what he said. He feels better with me around. It&rsquo;s not like CVRS ever does anything anyway. If they <i>do</i> manage to successfully predict a Branch, I guess that&rsquo;s good. But the odds of that are slim, especially lately. I mean, you&rsquo;ve heard how many rogue Branches have been popping up around here, right?&rdquo; They continued their rant as they pored over the manual. &ldquo;And they <i>definitely</i> don&rsquo;t do anything after the fact. They just poke around with this stupid little machines and go &lsquo;yeah, there was a Branch&rsquo; and then leave. Sometimes they&rsquo;ll even charge you a fee for poking around. They call it an &lsquo;assurance fee&rsquo; so you can have the CVRS certified stamp of bullshit on your building and can resume business as usual. It&rsquo;s all a con.&rdquo; Emory clapped the manual closed and nodded with clarity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Find anything useful?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not hardly. This freakin&rsquo; manual never helps. It&rsquo;s mostly filled with industry jargon anyway.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s usually supplemental material. To like&hellip;official training and stuff. It&rsquo;s not really meant to be distributed to to laypeople.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Man, you really are a CVRS bootlicker, huh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I just know a ton more than I ever cared to learn. Mostly thanks to Gen. Speaking of, there&rsquo;s no way she gave you a copy. Where&rsquo;d you even get that manual from?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Emory&rsquo;s shoulders flinched at the sound of a van door slamming outside. &ldquo;What are you, a cop? I&rsquo;m gonna go look in the back for anything suspicious.&rdquo; They skittered off to the back room as the bell above the front door chimed.</p>
<p>Danny turned to see a familiar face, his chest swelling with excitement. A short, muscular man with half-shaved, platinum blonde hair approached him with a charming smile. He was dressed casually with a simple white t-shirt under a taupe bomber jacket and orange-tinted, aviator-style glasses sitting atop the bridge of his strong nose. He carried himself with a level of confidence and charisma that Danny both envied and adored. There was someone else with him, but Danny didn&rsquo;t seem to notice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eli!&rdquo; Danny perked up, suddenly self conscious of the grody, near-death vibes he was exuding.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a pleasure as always, Danny,&rdquo; he nodded cordially, flashing his pearly whites. &ldquo;Sorry to drop in unannounced. The team for this area has been stretched thin, so I&rsquo;m picking up some cases outside of my usual route.&rdquo; He nodded to the large, broad-shouldered woman behind him and she gave a quick wave. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve met Frankie before, right? She&rsquo;s a Branch Analyst specializing in rogue Branches. Which brings me to why we&rsquo;re here. We got word from Rami there was a Suspended Branch here last night that CVRS wasn&rsquo;t prepared for. Do you know anything about that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Unfortunately.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, so I heard. Rami said Emory looped you in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Unfortunately,&rdquo; he repeated.</p>
<p>Eli smirked as both he and Frankie began clicking away on their CVRS-issued devices. Frankie pulled out her orange-tinted safety glasses and began meandering through the aisles. There was a brief pause as Eli sent off his findings, then he straightened with an amused expression. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re becoming a bit of celebrity around here, you know. We have a shorthand in our system that essentially says &lsquo;Emory was here&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I know. I keep telling them to just get a job with y&rsquo;all but they&rsquo;re just. You know. Emory.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I also know you don&rsquo;t like to talk about these things, Danny, but just knowing Emory was here gives me a pretty good idea of what happened. I&rsquo;ll look over what information Rami sent over and, as per usual, we&rsquo;d appreciate if you sent any relevant security footage. It&rsquo;s proven to be helpful one out of every hundred cases or so,&rdquo; he smirked. &ldquo;Other than that, anything suspicious here today?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not that I&rsquo;ve been able to notice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You feeling alright after all that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not any worse than you&rsquo;d expect.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Eli returned to his device with a soft smile. He looked up from under his dark lashes. &ldquo;Need anything?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A beer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well. I do have a shift at the bar later. Come see me, will you? Haven&rsquo;t seen you out in a while.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Danny cleared his throat and fidgeted with the collar of his uniform. &ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you, uh, on the clock? Are you really supposed to be offering beers to witnesses?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He rolled his eyes with a click of his teeth. &ldquo;Boo. No fun.&rdquo; He turned to call to Frankie, &ldquo;Find anything?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She straightened from the endcap where Emory had been snooping earlier. &ldquo;Nothing too crazy. Just typical post-Branch residue, some fairly high concentrations of ions, but nothing you wouldn&rsquo;t expect to see after an amateur Suspension&hellip;&rdquo; they rambled as they approached the counter. &ldquo;Emory&rsquo;s reliable, but my god they&rsquo;re messy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I told them they gotta cool it with the magical bat,&rdquo; Danny smirked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, if you see them,&rdquo; Eli began as he slipped his hand into his jacket pocket, &ldquo;tell them&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t bother, Eli. They know where to find you. And Rami. And the rest of CVRS. In fact, you&rsquo;ll probably see them tonight when we inevitably stop by the bar after ramen. You can grill &lsquo;em then.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, no thanks. Last time I tried that, I had a broken bottle pointed at my neck.&rdquo; He stuffed his business card back in his pocket with a gentle smile. &ldquo;But I&rsquo;m glad to hear you&rsquo;ll be at the bar after all.&rdquo;</p>
<hr/>
<p>&ldquo;One of my favorite parts about ramen is the egg. It <i>has</i> to be a soft- or medium-boiled egg, otherwise I&rsquo;m causing a scene. One time I tried a new place that served me an un-marinated, hard-boiled egg. It was overcooked; the yolk was practically gray! Ruined my appetite for the rest of the week. Guess that&rsquo;s what I get for fuckin&rsquo; with tradition. But here? They do it right.&rdquo; Danny held up a silencing hand as he popped half of a golden, oozing ramen egg in his mouth with a pleasure-filled moan. &ldquo;<i>God,</i> they&rsquo;ve got it down. They&rsquo;re called ajitama, you know. Shorthand for <i>ajitsuke tamago</i>, literally &lsquo;ramen egg&rsquo;. I personally prefer soft-boiled, but I won&rsquo;t get too mad if it&rsquo;s between soft and medium. The yolk should be a bit jammy, kind of custard-y. Did you know&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Danny.&rdquo; Gen interrupted with a sigh. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve given this monologue a million times. I could give a lecture on ramen eggs at this point.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, but I like this next part!&rdquo; Rami perked up. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s about the different cooking rates of egg whites and egg yolks. It&rsquo;s fascinating.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t encourage him, honey. This is the ramen egg monologue he gives when he&rsquo;s avoiding something.&rdquo; Gen turned to him with a raised brow. &ldquo;So, what are you avoiding, Danny?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing,&rdquo; he grumbled, twisting noodles around his chopsticks. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s just get this check-in over with.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is that really what you think this is?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it not? And&mdash;&rdquo; he held us a silencing finger to cut off Rami, &ldquo;&mdash;before you say anything! I <i>know</i> it&rsquo;s a &lsquo;thank you&rsquo; for &lsquo;helping&rsquo; with yesterday, but I wouldn&rsquo;t be shocked if it wasn&rsquo;t also a way for you to check in on me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Christ, Danny. I haven&rsquo;t seen you in person in over three months. I just thought this would be a nice way for us to all get together and check in <i>collectively,</i> so we can all see how we&rsquo;re doing. As friends.&rdquo; She gestured to the four of them. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s just go around the circle and give updates. Emory? You first.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Emory perked up from their face having been buried in their ramen bowl, now nearly empty. &ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m fine. Trying to decide if I should get seconds.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I heard you were out playing Target Hunter again last night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hell yeah. It was heaps fun.&rdquo; Emory pulled the bowl up to their mouth and loudly slurped the remaining broth.</p>
<p>Gen gave Rami an encouraging nudge, gesturing to Emory with her eyes as if to remark <i>&ldquo;Would you please say something?&rdquo;</i></p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! My turn?&rdquo; Rami straightened with an eager smile as Gen affectionately rolled her eyes. &ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m doing great! Just busy. Work&rsquo;s been crazy lately! We&rsquo;re practically at capacity, if we aren&rsquo;t already. This area&rsquo;s been swamped! It&rsquo;s no wonder we keep having rogue Branches and our external team had to contract out. You know I got a call from Eli today, right Danny? He said he was gonna stop by the gas station and talk with you. Did you get to see him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O-oh. Yeah.&rdquo; His shoulders shrunk as he returned to his bowl.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gosh, he&rsquo;s as charming as always,&rdquo; Rami hummed. &ldquo;So professional! It&rsquo;s so funny hearing him talk in his CVRS voice when I&rsquo;m so used to his bartender voice. When&rsquo;s the last time you saw him? He mentioned he hadn&rsquo;t heard from you in a while. We should say hi tonight!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I, uh&hellip;yeah. It&rsquo;s been a while. I told him we&rsquo;d swing by.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rami clapped his hands together with a beaming smile. &ldquo;Oh yay! He makes the <i>best</i> drinks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yeah, he does.&rdquo; Danny cleared his throat and gestured to Gen. &ldquo;And you? How are you Gen? Is the, uh, the chaos in the Active ward causing y&rsquo;all trouble?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gen adjusted her large, round glasses atop the bridge of her nose. &ldquo;Honestly, we haven&rsquo;t seen an influx in patients, which is good, but a little odd. You&rsquo;d think all the rogue Branches would result in new patients, but most everything seems to be acute instances, so we haven&rsquo;t been affected all that much and things have been pretty quiet.&rdquo; She turned, her sword earrings sparkling as they settled into place. The overhead light cast a glare on her glasses and her glittery black nails shimmered as she thoughtfully interlocked her fingers. &ldquo;And you, Danny? How are you after yesterday?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fine,&rdquo; he answered quickly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fine-fine or just fine?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just fine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Horns?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Normal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Scar?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Normal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stomach aches?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Normal,&rdquo; he grunted, clearly irritated.</p>
<p>She paused for a second, as if to give him a breath. &ldquo;Are you sleeping well?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He clenched his jaw. &ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t Emory and Rami&rsquo;s check-ins come with an invasive status update?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nine times out of ten, they usually just tell me. I don&rsquo;t have to ask.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah yeah, I don&rsquo;t have any problem talked about this shit.&rdquo; Emory rain their fingers through their hair and parted their shaggy bangs to reveal a small, rounded black horn protruding from the top middle of their skull. &ldquo;See? Looks good to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Looks a bit bigger than last time, if I had to be honest&hellip;&rdquo; Rami peered over the table, &ldquo;but nothing to be worried about, I don&rsquo;t think.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yours?&rdquo; Emory raised their brows as they ruffled their hair back into place.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, without getting too&hellip;well&hellip;technical,&rdquo; Rami quickly glanced at Danny, &ldquo;They seemed to fall off a few months ago. My Core likely shifted again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Those Delta Vices are weird, huh? I guess that&rsquo;s a good thing?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure,&rdquo; Rami shrugged. &ldquo;Not giving me any trouble, so I can&rsquo;t complain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;See?&rdquo; Gen gestured to them with a content smile. &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t even have to nudge.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well pardon me for not talking about every physiological update I have. If I told you every time I had a stomach ache or my horns got a quarter of an inch bigger, CVRS would be at my house weekly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know that&rsquo;s <i>literally</i> the worst thing to say to a Vice Management Specialist, right? Is it really any wonder why I worry about you so much? And I wouldn&rsquo;t <i>have</i> to worry so much if you&rsquo;d just go to CVRS and get regular checkups.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Babe&hellip;&rdquo; Rami gently placed his hand over her arm. &ldquo;Danny, it&rsquo;s not&hellip;ugh, hold on. Gen, you can&rsquo;t&hellip;augh, okay. Danny, you hate CVRS. We get that. We just&hellip;want to make sure you&rsquo;re alright. And we&rsquo;re&hellip;we&rsquo;re here for you if you need us and want to talk. But we can&rsquo;t help you if you don&rsquo;t talk.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Danny pinched the bridge of his nose. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m fine, y&rsquo;all. Really.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hey, if it makes y&rsquo;all feel any better,&rdquo; Emory began, picking the leftover fixins out of Rami&rsquo;s bowl, &ldquo;I can keep an eye on him. Lawrence has me patrolling the gas station anyway.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t need a fucking babysitter, Emory.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not babysitting. It&rsquo;s more like&hellip;a wellness check.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t need that, either.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You shouldn&rsquo;t be patrolling the gas station anyway.&rdquo; Gen pointed with a judging finger. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t go poking your nose where it doesn&rsquo;t belong.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They were <i>literally</i> sniffling floor tiles earlier,&rdquo; Danny interjected with a sly grin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, <i>come on</i>!&rdquo; Emory threw their hands up. &ldquo;CVRS showed up and didn&rsquo;t even do anything! It&rsquo;s all a bunch of box-checking! Sometimes it feels like I&rsquo;m the only one who cares about any of this shit!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Emory, please,&rdquo; Gen groaned. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re literally talking to two CVRS agents.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This isn&rsquo;t about <i>y&rsquo;all,</i> it&rsquo;s about this area&rsquo;s shitty Target Hunters not doing their job!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re <i>overworked</i>, Emory.&rdquo; Rami exhaled an exasperated sigh. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re trying their best. They can only keep up with so much. That&rsquo;s why we&rsquo;re contracting other teams. That&rsquo;s why we got to see Eli today! A-and speaking of&hellip;&rdquo; Rami stood up and began gathering his utensils. &ldquo;Sounds like we could all use a drink, huh? No more Vice talk, no more CVRS talk, no more updates, alright? Let&rsquo;s just do what we actually went out tonight to do: head next door for a drink and enjoy each other&rsquo;s company. Okay?&rdquo; He clapped his hands together and looked around with frantic, begging eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yep,&rdquo; Emory grunted as they rose to their feet. &ldquo;I could use a drink. Danny? First one&rsquo;s on me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He slumped across the table with a whine. &ldquo;I wanna go home. I&rsquo;m tired.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Emory picked him up by the back of his collar like a scruffed kitten. &ldquo;Nuh-uh. You gotta go tell your hot bartender hi like you promised.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you not want to see him?&rdquo; Rami&rsquo;s eyes grew big and watery. &ldquo;Did something happen?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Danny shooed Emory away as he stumbled to his feet. &ldquo;No, no, I just. Feel bad. Haven&rsquo;t reached out in a while.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who knows, Rami. I barely have the energy to function. Social interaction has never really been at the top of my priorities.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well! Then I&rsquo;m glad we all get to see him tonight. He&rsquo;s such a treat. This&rsquo;ll be great!&rdquo; He clapped his hands together and led the way toward the bar.</p>
<p>Gen filed out behind Danny and meekly tugged at his sleeve for him to pull back. He looked over his shoulder to see Gen&rsquo;s watery eyes shimmering from the neon signs above them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know I love you, right?&rdquo; she whimpered softly.</p>
<p>He stopped and faced her with a sigh. &ldquo;Oh god, Gen. Of course I do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not doing these things to judge you. I hadn&rsquo;t heard from you in a while, and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gen, I know. I promise. I&rsquo;m just&hellip;putting my energy towards surviving right now, okay? I don&rsquo;t have the time or the energy to be thinking about this stuff. I&rsquo;m lucky if I can remember to eat, alright? I&rsquo;ll reach out if things get bad. Promise.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She studied his face, and her shoulders fell with relent. There was much more she had to say, but she refrained. &ldquo;Good. Let Emory buy you a drink tonight. Then let me buy you one too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He threw his arm around her and gave her a quick squeeze. &ldquo;I <i>do</i> still have to go to work tomorrow, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cash in that sick day you should&rsquo;ve taken today, and let&rsquo;s get stupid.&rdquo;</p>
