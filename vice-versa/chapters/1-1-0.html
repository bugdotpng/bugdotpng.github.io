        <h1>v1.1.0</h1>
        <p>Danny wanted nothing more than to stay home and rot, but by 6 a.m., he found himself shuffling through his dimly lit kitchen, propelled by routine and guided by muscle memory. He continued to ignore the persistent, miserable weight of exhaustion pulling at his joints and waded through the thick slurry of depression to grab himself a granola bar. The TV static ever-present in the back of his mind stoked the smoldering remains of a migraine.</p>
<p>Any rational person would call in from work, but the thought never crossed his mind, at least not as something he was allowed to do. Lawrence would have absolutely let him stay home, especially given the circumstances, but Danny never registered it as an option. He needed money and the only way he had to get said money was by going to work; it was as simple as that, no nuance allowed.</p>
<p>Part of him knew that spending time alone in his room wasn&rsquo;t going to make him feel better anyway. His empty apartment merely served as a reminder of just how persistent his depression was, and spending hours under a blanket to curate a mental list of everything wrong only served to perpetuate the cycle. Piles of washed laundry covered two thirds of the couch, and clean dishes crowded the dishwasher, leaving no room for the ones he had left to &ldquo;soak&rdquo;. Half of the lightbulbs in his living room were out, and the crispy leaves of his pothos weakly reached toward the slivers of light peeking through the narrow window by his front door. His living quarters didn&rsquo;t exactly incite a desire to live, so going to work&mdash;despite it all&mdash;was the best option on the table.</p>
<p>That is, of course, until he walked through the doors to see Lawrence chatting with Emory. His headache returned with a vengeance, causing him to wince.</p>
<p>Emory looked over their shoulder with a smile that immediately fell to a disgusted grimace. &ldquo;Christ alive, Danny. You look like shit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lawrence lightly batted Emory&rsquo;s arm. &ldquo;Hey. Be nice to my favorite employee. I&rsquo;m lucky he&rsquo;s even in today.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not being mean, I&rsquo;m stating facts! Why&rsquo;d you even come in? I didn&rsquo;t expect you to be here after all that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m here,&rdquo; he grumbled as he squeezed behind the counter.</p>
<p>Emory leaned toward Lawrence, whispering behind their hand. &ldquo;Geez, don&rsquo;t you let your employees take sick time?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know I do,&rdquo; Lawrence rolled his eyes. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s a stubborn one, though. Have you ever tried to convince him to do anything?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All the time. He&rsquo;s easy to push around.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me rephrase. Have you ever convinced him to do something&nbsp;<i>good</i> for himself?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah. Never.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Danny punched the register closed with a loud chime to remind them he was within hearing distance.</p>
<p>Emory dismissed him with a wave of their hand. &ldquo;Anyway, Lawrence. Glad to hear things have been quiet since last night. I gave you the CVRS card, but here&rsquo;s my number if you ever need me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Much appreciated, Emory. CVRS hasn&rsquo;t done much for me in the past, anyway. I&rsquo;d rather call you before them anytime.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Lawrence,&rdquo; Emory bashfully turned away. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll hang around today to make sure nothing else pops up, just for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quit acting like you&rsquo;re doing this out of the goodness of your heart,&rdquo; Danny called from the counter. &ldquo;Lawrence, they&rsquo;re just using you for your hot chips.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I know,&rdquo; Lawrence patted Emory&rsquo;s shoulder. &ldquo;But I do feel a bit more at ease with you around, and peace of mind is worth a couple bags of hot chips. Help yourself to some, by all means. I&rsquo;ll be in the back if you need me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Emory flashed Danny a smug grin as they scurried to the hot chips endcap. He could hear rustling as they stuffed their jacket pockets full. &ldquo;Hey Danny, think fast!&rdquo; They jumped out from behind the endcap to launch a chip bag at lightning speed directly for his head.</p>
<p>He slapped the bag away and heaved an exhausted sigh. Emory smiled weakly and awkwardly gestured to the chip bag, now laying on the floor. &ldquo;Y&rsquo;know&hellip;as thanks or whatever. For helpin&rsquo; out.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So thoughtful,&rdquo; he grunted as he picked it up off the floor. Emory nervously drummed their fingers as he tore the bag open. He fished around for the chips with the most dust and narrowed his eyes at Emory. &ldquo;Do you need something?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Emory averted eye contact and sheepishly pursed their lips. &ldquo;I, uh, I do appreciate your help n&rsquo; all, actually.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can tell by the hot chips you so graciously threw at me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I tend to&hellip;you know&hellip;get caught up in it all, sometimes. It&rsquo;s exhilarating.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad you get a kick out of it,&rdquo; he grumbled through half-chewed chips.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I, well&hellip;I forget it has that effect on you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you just not listen when I talk?&rdquo; he threw his hands up with a scoff. &ldquo;I said that at least three times yesterday. And probably a million before that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t really listen to anyone, if that makes you feel better.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It really doesn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I do wanna make it up to you! I&rsquo;ll try my best to not get you &lsquo;looped in&rsquo; to any more of my &lsquo;shenanigans&rsquo;. But in the meantime, why don&rsquo;t we all go get ramen or something? My treat?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Danny squinted suspiciously. &ldquo;Did Rami put you up to this? Or Gen?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Both, technically. But I ignored them, and now I&rsquo;m doing this because I feel bad. You look awful.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You really suck at apologizing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let ramen fill the void where my words have failed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t fucking stand you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Be that as it may, Danny still couldn&rsquo;t resist the alluring siren call of ramen. His eye-roll followed by a shrug told Emory that he reluctantly agreed to the arrangement, despite his better judgment, so they flashed a satisfied grin and hopped away to inspect the scene of the crime from the night before.</p>
<p>Ramen was known to be Danny&rsquo;s meal of choice when he didn&rsquo;t feel well, but knowing he would likely get grilled by Gen or Rami, he wasn&rsquo;t sure if he would actually leave feeling any better. Though, if he declined a ramen outing, Gen and Rami would&rsquo;ve likely shown up at his door anyway.</p>
<p>His relationship with Rami&ndash;and especially Gen&ndash;often teetered on a bizarre tightrope between &ldquo;best friend&rdquo; and &ldquo;trusted medical professional&rdquo;. While Rami was often more concerned with corralling Emory, Danny knew that he was always under the quiet, watchful eye of Gen. It was unavoidable, he figured, due to her morbid fascination with vicology since their middle school days. One big incident and suddenly their relationship went from two edgy teens against the world to a scientist and her research subject against the world.</p>
<p>Every &ldquo;how are you feeling&rdquo; had an air of couch psychiatrist to it that Danny couldn&rsquo;t ignore. He knew deep in his heart that Gen cared about him and wanted him to thrive, but lately every interaction felt like she was gathering data. He wasn&rsquo;t sure if it was because he was getting steadily worse and that was her way of caring, or because Gen was stuck in some vicological research rabbit hole and he happened to be the perfect subject.</p>
<p>Regardless, he began steeling himself for the inevitable interrogation. He could already feel his patience wearing thin as he watched Emory sniff around the endcap where the Host was Suspended. As in, they were literally on their knees sniffing floor tiles.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what helpful smells you think you&rsquo;re going to find over there,&rdquo; Danny began with a sigh, &ldquo;but good luck deciphering anything. All I can ever smell is whatever the hell&rsquo;s been getting progressively funkier over the last few weeks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, you smell that, too? I was trying to figure out where it was coming from. Might be a clue. Dunno what to, but it&rsquo;s sure as hell bound to be rank when we find it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s probably just a rat carcass rotting between the walls. If it gets any worse I&rsquo;ll call pest control. Now get off the floor. God forbid we ever have a customer come in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You really don&rsquo;t think it could be a clue? Haven&rsquo;t you watched any horror movies? The smell of rot always precedes&hellip;uh&hellip;I dunno, ghosts and shit?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We live in Texas, Emory. If it&rsquo;s not a rat, it&rsquo;s probably a racoon. Or an armadillo. Or an opossum. Or a bird. I&rsquo;d list off all the native animals of Texas before I ever considered it being a ghost.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Emory ignored him as they hopped to their feet. They scratched their chin as they mused aloud. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not really rot, though, is it? I know what dead animals smell like, and this really isn&rsquo;t that. I can&rsquo;t quite put my finger on it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know why you&rsquo;re trying to get to that bottom of that, of all things. This building is at least 60 years old. God knows what&rsquo;s crawled in our walls and died or what&rsquo;s embedded in the linoleum. Well, I mean&hellip;<i>I&nbsp;</i>know. I had to clean them just last week. It&rsquo;s nothing supernatural, I&rsquo;ll tell you that. Horrific, sure. Supernatural, no.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Emory shifted their musings to private grumblings and began pacing up and down the aisles. They pulled a rolled collection of papers from the inner pocket of their utility jacket.</p>
<p>Danny rolled his eyes and turned to take inventory. &ldquo;Oh, come on. You&rsquo;ve got to quit playing Target Hunter, Emory.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s what Lawrence is paying me to do. Might as well cover all my bases.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s not paying you. He&rsquo;s letting you hang around and eat chips because he knows you got nothing better to do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Y&rsquo;know, Danny,&rdquo; Emory hummed as they scanned the crumpled pages. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re kind of a dick.&rdquo; Before he could retort, they continued, &ldquo;But you heard what he said. He feels better with me around since CVRS is notorious for sucking.&rdquo; They clapped the papers closed and nodded with certainty.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Figure it out?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not hardly. This freakin manual never has anything helpful.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s usually supplemental material. To like&hellip;official training and stuff. It&rsquo;s not really meant to be distributed to to laypeople.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Man, you really&nbsp;<i>are</i> a CVRS bootlicker, huh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I just know a ton more than I ever cared to learn. Mostly thanks to Gen. Speaking of, there&rsquo;s no way she gave you a copy. Where&rsquo;d you even get that manual from?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Emory&rsquo;s shoulders flinched at the sound of a van door slamming outside. &ldquo;What are you, a cop? I&rsquo;m gonna go look in the back for anything suspicious.&rdquo; They skittered off to the back room as the bell above the front door chimed.</p>
<p>Danny turned to see a familiar face, his chest swelling with excitement. A short, muscular man with half-shaved, platinum blonde hair approached him with a charming smile. He was dressed casually with a simple white t-shirt under a taupe bomber jacket and orange-tinted, aviator-style glasses sitting atop the bridge of his strong nose. He carried himself with a level of confidence and charisma that Danny both envied and adored. There was someone else with him, but Danny didn&rsquo;t seem interested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eli!&rdquo; Danny perked up, suddenly self conscious of the grody, near-death vibes he was exuding.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a pleasure as always, Danny,&rdquo; he nodded cordially, flashing his pearly whites. &ldquo;Sorry to drop in unannounced. The team for this area has been stretched thin, so I&rsquo;m picking up some cases outside of my usual route.&rdquo; He nodded to the tall, slender woman behind him and she gave a modest wave. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve met Eve before, right? She&rsquo;s a Branch Analyst and specializes in rogue Branches. Which brings me to why we&rsquo;re here. We got word from Rami there was a Suspended Branch here last night that CVRS didn&rsquo;t know about. Do you know anything about that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Unfortunately.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, so I heard. Rami said Emory looped you in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Unfortunately,&rdquo; he repeated.</p>
<p>Eli smirked as both he and Eve began clicking away on their CVRS-issued devices. Eve pulled out her orange-tinted safety glasses and began meandering through the aisles. There was a brief pause as Eli sent off his findings, then he straightened with an amused expression. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re becoming a bit of celebrity around here, you know. We have a shorthand in our system that essentially says &lsquo;Emory was here&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I know. I keep telling them to just get a job with y&rsquo;all but they&rsquo;re just. You know. Emory.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I also know you don&rsquo;t like to talk about these things, Danny, but just knowing Emory was here gives me a pretty good idea of what happened. I&rsquo;ll look over what information Rami sent over and, as per usual, we&rsquo;d appreciate if you sent any relevant security footage. It&rsquo;s proven to be helpful one out of every hundred cases or so,&rdquo; he smirked. &ldquo;Other than that, anything suspicious here today?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not that I&rsquo;ve been able to notice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You feeling alright after all that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not any worse than you&rsquo;d expect.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Eli returned to his device with a soft smile. He looked up from under his dark lashes. &ldquo;Need anything?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A beer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well. I do have a shift at the bar later. Come see me, will you? Haven&rsquo;t seen you out in a while.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Danny cleared his throat as he stabled himself against the counter. &ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you, uh, on the clock? Are you really supposed to be offering beers to witnesses?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He rolled his eyes with a click of his teeth. &ldquo;Boo. No fun.&rdquo; He turned to call to Eve, &ldquo;Find anything?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She straightened from the endcap where Emory had been snooping earlier. &ldquo;Nothing too crazy. Just typical post-Branch residue, some fairly high concentrations of ions, but nothing you wouldn&rsquo;t expect to see after an amateur Suspension&hellip;&rdquo; they rambled as they approached the counter. &ldquo;Emory&rsquo;s reliable, but my god they&rsquo;re messy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I told them they gotta cool it with the magical bat,&rdquo; Danny smirked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, if you see them,&rdquo; Eli began as he slipped his hand into his jacket pocket, &ldquo;tell them&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t bother, Eli. They know where to find you. And Rami. And the rest of CVRS. In fact, you&rsquo;ll probably see them tonight when we inevitably stop by the bar after ramen. You can grill &lsquo;em then.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, no thanks. Last time I tried that, I had a broken bottle pointed at my neck.&rdquo; He stuffed his business card back in his pocket with a gentle smile. &ldquo;But I&rsquo;m glad to hear you&rsquo;ll be at the bar after all.&rdquo;</p>
