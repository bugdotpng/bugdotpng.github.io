                    <blockquote>
                      <p>A young child fidgeted restlessly in a creaky, wooden chair, alone in the familiar tiled room. He had a timid posture, his head lowered and hands placed neatly in his lap. Wavy, shoulder-length hair shrouded his face and cascaded down his cheeks in loose, brunette spirals. The fluorescent lights relentlessly bore down from above, urging beads of sweat across his anxious brow as his heart fluttered in anticipation.</p>
                    </blockquote>
                    <p>The scene had been relentlessly looping in the back of Danny's head all morning. It wasn't particularly surprising that he was having these dreams again, considering yesterday's events. Vices seemed to be an unavoidable topic at the moment, no matter how hard he tried to avoid them, and these dreams&mdash;or memories, rather&mdash;tended to resurface when too much attention was brought to the parasite writhing inside of him. Sure, it was Emory who actually had the Branch, but it reminded him that they truly were at the mercy of their sentient tumors. The hair on the back of his neck had been standing on-end since yesterday.</p>
                    <p>"Danny?" Rami jarred him from his trance as he thumbed through an intimidatingly thick stack of papers. "I could really use your cooperation here. My shift starts soon."</p>
                    <p>He muttered an apology as he shifted his gangly body in the awkwardly-shaped office chair.</p>
                    <p>They were meeting in what appeared to be a generic CVRS administrative area, any and all surfaces devoid of character. The already small office was crammed with two bulky chairs and an unnecessarily large, wooden desk that Rami also struggled to get comfortable behind. His coordinated planner decorated with puffy stickers and rainbow tabs brought some much-needed color into the room, and the tight quarters allowed for his warm, bergamot fragrance to overpower the trademark CVRS stench of rubbing alcohol. Rami's presence had done a good job of making the circumstances almost tolerable, had they been doing literally anything other than talking about Vices.</p>
                    <p>"So, can you do that?" Rami continued shuffling papers around, pausing periodically to quickly scribble out a signature.</p>
                    <p>"Can I do what?"</p>
                    <p>"Fill this out and hand to Kieran at the front desk before you leave. But before that..." He pushed the stack of papers toward him, then patted around the various pockets of his lab coat. "...we've gotta do an oral interview."</p>
                    <p>Rami didn't have to look up to know Danny's face had fallen into a scowl.</p>
                    <p>"Don't look at me like that. It's just protocol. Don't take any of this personally."</p>
                    <p>"Hard not to," he muttered.</p>
                    <p>"Listen, I'm on your side, man. Gah, where's the stupid..." His coat-searching grew more frantic the more empty pockets he came across. "I mean, I was the one who insisted on conducting the interview instead of a Branch Recovery Specialist, as is standard protocol. BRS agents are notoriously thorough and probably would've had you trapped here for hours. Aha!" He whipped out a dated tape recorder and placed it squarely between them, gently nudging it to the perfect center. "I'm doing this off the clock, too, mind you. Figured this way would be easier on you."</p>
                    <p>"No part of this is easy."</p>
                    <p>"Easy-<em>er</em>. Trying my best here."</p>
                    <p>For the first time that morning, he had finally made eye contact with Danny. He seemed frazzled, twitchy, even more than usual. There was a tightness in the corner of his mouth that alluded to a negative emotion Danny couldn't quite put his finger on. Irritation, perhaps?</p>
                    <p>Danny knew something was off when Rami got straight to business without so much as a "Morning! How are you doing?" or any other greeting he had in his arsenal of social niceties. It wasn't like he necessarily wanted to expound on his current headspace, but the gesture would've at least been appreciated.</p>
                    <p>The orange-tinted lenses of Rami's small, round glasses were awash with the fluorescent lighting overhead, sending a beam of light back at Danny that gave the allusion he was under a spotlight. He couldn't help but feel like his every move was being studied behind those trademark amber lenses.</p>
                    <p>His chest tightened. "Why can't you just fudge the responses and let me out of here? I'm not gonna be all that much help anyway."</p>
                    <p>"Well, this may come as a surprise to you, Danny," Rami sighed as he tented his fingers with a thin, forced smile. "I care about Emory's well-being and would like to know if there's anything out of sorts with this Branch." He hovered his hand over the tape recorder. "Sooner we get started, the sooner I can get you out of here."</p>
                    <p>With a mechanical click, the interview began.</p>

                    <p>Rami covered the recorder. "Dude, just answer the question."</p>
                    <p>"Nuh-uh. Not if you're gonna be asking leading questions like that! Are you saying it was my fault?"</p>
                    <p>"I'm just trying to get a better idea of what was happening when the Branch was initiated!"</p>
                    <p>"I told you! It was probably Frankie! Geez, you were harping on BRS agents for being particular. Would they be cornering me like this or are we in a conflict-of-interest sort of situation?"</p>
                    <p>"That's not a thing. I'm just saying, from my experience, it takes a little more than getting reprimanded for them to have a Branch. They get their hand slapped all the time! That's not a usual trigger for them, so I'm trying to figure out if there was anything else y'all talked about. It doesn't even have to be bad; I just need to know the details since I wasn't there! I'm trying to figure out if this was a rogue Branch or if something from their usual Branch Ops was mentioned."</p>
                    <p>Danny realized that the growing tightness in his chest was not anxiety from being observed, it was the guilt that had been festering in the back of his head since he was admitted to Emory's Branch. It wasn't as if Emory was the picture of grace and free of blame, but as someone whose schtick was avoiding Vices, it didn't feel great to have triggered someone's Branch, even if it wasn't intentional. That was almost worse, somehow. He had accused Emory of being reckless with their actions, but Danny had been reckless with his words.</p>
                    <p>He composed himself to answer, hoping that taking the interview seriously was a good enough substitute for penance. His chest had tightened so quickly that he began with a breathy squeak.</p>

                    <p>Rami’s expression softened; he almost looked thankful. Never mind that Danny hadn’t told the entire story, that he was way harsher than he was letting on. Emory was already riled up well before he started laying into them. No sense in telling on himself any more than he needed to.</p>

                        <p>Goddammit, Rami! I don’t know! I just&mdash;I just got there! I just opened my eyes, and I was in the garage. I don’t really know how to elaborate on that. What’s the point in making me do this? I’m not going to be helpful! I had no idea what was going on!</p>

                    </div>
                    <p>Rami paused the recorder and tented his fingers with a gentle smile. He seemed to be gathering his thoughts, while also giving Danny's blood pressure time to equalize. He continued softly, "Danny, it's okay. There aren't any wrong answers."</p>
                    <p>"Oh, come on. That's bullshit. You definitely made me feel like I was giving the wrong answer earlier!"</p>
                    <p>"I never said that. I was just looking for clarification. All I ask of you is to be honest and thoughtful in your answers."</p>
                    <p>"Why are you even saying that? Do you think I'm not?"</p>
                    <p>"No, Danny! Geez! I'm pausing the interview to give you time to collect yourself and remind you what I need! That's it! I'm trying to make this easier for you, okay?"</p>
                    <p>"What part of this is easy, Rami? You know I hate CVRS! Why would you make me come here?"</p>
                    <p>Rami squeezed his eyes shut and firmly rubbed at his furrowed brow. "Anything you're getting pissed off about here is because of protocol, okay? I'm doing my best to accommodate you, but I have to adhere to process, too. If I do, you won't have to come back. If I don't, CVRS is going to be harassing you to come back in for a redo. I'm in a tough spot here, but I really am trying my best, and it would mean a lot to me if you recognized that."</p>
                    <p>"I'm trying my best, too, but I don't remember anything, Rami! I'm not going to be helpful! This was my first time as an Adjunct, and I had no idea what was going on! This all feels like such a waste of everyone's time! And <em>god</em>, if I <em>did</em> happen to remember any of it, it was all obliterated when I got my arm ripped open, and I was too busy worrying if I was going to bleed out or not!"</p>
                    <p>Rami glanced at the bandage around his forearm and his shoulders slumped with pity. He pushed up his glasses and rubbed his eyes with a sigh. "God, Danny, I'm sorry. I feel like such an ass. I didn't even ask how you were feeling."</p>
                    <p>He held his arm to his chest and turned his head with a huff. "I don't want your sympathy if it's not genuine."</p>
                    <p>Rami planted his elbows on the table and held his face in his hands as he exhaled a long, weak groan. He rubbed at his face with frustration. "What do you want from me, man?"</p>
                    <p>Danny fidgeted with the bunched-up edges of his bandages, his face scrunched into a pouting scowl. "Nothing, sorry. I'm just being difficult."</p>
                    <p>"I know you're plagued by Little Brother Syndrome, but you gotta give me a break, man. It's not even 8 a.m. and I'm already exhausted."</p>
                    <p>He slid down his chair. "I'm tired, too."</p>
                    <p>"I know, I'm sorry. I wish you didn't have to do this, but it is what it is. Now," Rami tented his fingers and raised his brows. "How are you feeling?"</p>
                    <p>"Physically, I'm surprisingly okay. It wasn't even that bad. I was shocked I basically just ended up with a long paper cut after all that."</p>
                    <p>"Mmhmm. That's Branch logic for you."</p>
                    <p>"I'm honestly only wearing this because I keep reopening it. Hard not to when it runs my whole forearm. Whatever. At least it's not a gaping flesh wound like it was in the Branch Arena."</p>
                    <p>"It's crazy, isn't it? Been doing this for years, and I still don't really understand how that works."</p>
                    <p>"Wish it did the same thing with emotions. It's kinda crazy how you're expected to just...go back to your routine like you didn't just stare death in the face. Doesn't really matter if it was in the Branch Arena; it was still terrifying."</p>
                    <p>Rami straightened to attention; his sparkling eyes seemed almost eager. He leaned toward him and nodded, encouraging him to continue. Danny hadn't willingly divulged his Vice-related feelings in years, and Rami was almost too afraid to respond, worried he would spook him like he was a stray cat.</p>
                    <p>Danny narrowed his eyes. "That's it. That's all I have to say."</p>
                    <p>"What? No, come on! Let's talk about it!" Rami flipped his watch to catch the time. "I've got about 10 minutes before my shift starts if you need to get anything off your chest."</p>
                    <p>He muttered as he brought his knees to his chest, struggling to fit his balled-up body in the clunky office chair. "Ugh, no. That's enough emotional vulnerability for me."</p>
                    <p>"It's one thing to experience your own Branch, but other people's can be just as intense. We can talk about it&mdash;"</p>
                    <p>"No, I'm good. I just wanna get out of here."</p>
                    <p>"I could schedule you an appointment with a&mdash;"</p>
                    <p>"No, Rami. I'm fine. The quicker I get out of here, the better."</p>
                    <p>Rami slumped down his chair with a resigning sigh. "Fine, fine."</p>

                    <p>"Thank god, but what's the point, then? Really?"</p>
                    <p>"I don't know how many times I have to say this, Danny, but it's protocol. It's always protocol. Plus, I wanted to confirm my suspicions that this was a rogue Branch. That's all, but we're done here."</p>
                    <p>Rami slipped the recorder back into his pocket, then flipped through his planner to a page of stickers. He peeled off a bright yellow sun and placed it above the pocket. He then flashed a beaming smile and handed Danny a grumpy orange cat sticker, which he begrudgingly affixed to the collar of his work polo.</p>

                  <p>He paused for a moment, trying to gauge Danny's status, but he was too busy glaring at the stack of papers to notice. He couldn't quite tell what he was thinking. "I do have a few minutes if you wanna talk about&mdash;"</p>
                  <p>"No, Rami. I'm fine."</p>
                  <p>He exhaled an unconvinced grunt as he lightly nudged the stack of papers toward Danny. "First half of the packet is standard paperwork, legalities and biographical info and such. After that, I documented my experience in the Branch Arena, and I'd like you to read through the transcript. At the top of every page is a highlighted box for you to initial if you agree that my notes match up with your experience. Then toward the back, there's a place to add any additional observations that I may not have noticed. After that, there's a couple Branch Recovery questions about any injuries incurred, but they're not in-depth. Sign at the end, and turn it in to Kieran. Then you're free to go."</p>
                  <p>"Y'all are about as bad as doctor offices, huh?" Danny squinted at the tightly-packed, near-illegible legalese. "I'd better not be signing my life away."</p>
                  <p>His attempt at humor was lost on Rami, who had already stood up and was smoothing the wrinkles in his coat, his mind elsewhere. "Kieran can help if you have any questions. Anyway, I gotta head out. Thanks again for doing this."</p>
                  <p>Danny offered a grunt as if to say, <em>"Like I had a choice."</em> as Rami firmly planted his hand on his shoulder and gave him a supportive shake. With a nod, Rami swung the door open a bolted down the hallway, a rush of rubbing alcohol surging in behind him.</p>
                  <p>The stack of papers might as well have been glaring back at him, what with how his stomach lurched when he looked at them. He weighed his options: stay holed up in this cramped office or awkwardly fumble with the clipboard in his lap in front of everyone in the waiting room. Better yet, maybe he could awkwardly fumble with the clipboard and breeze through the paperwork during his walk down the corridor. It was certainly long enough.</p>
                  <p>He gathered his papers and poked his head out the door, cautiously surveying his surroundings. Not a single person&mdash;agent or patient&mdash;was in the absurdly long hallway, making it seem like it stretched for miles in both directions. This would give him plenty of uninterrupted time to flip through the packet, or so he thought.</p>
                  <p>He attempted to read as he walked, but found himself stopping every few steps to reread the same sentences over and over. He stood in the middle of the hallway, squinting at the lengthy paragraph he was holding a few inches from his face. The packet was chock-full of disclaimers, fluff, and industry jargon, and despite his familiarity with the CVRS lexicon, he struggled to parse exactly what the legalese and even Rami were saying. It didn't help that the rubbing alcohol assaulting his nostrils was making it difficult for him to think. Waves of nausea made sweat bloom across his brow.</p>
                  <p>With his gaze fixed on the incomprehensible mess of words, the walls around him began to close in on him, his breaths became shallow, and a growing, external pressure began to push against his temples. He whipped his head up with a gasp, the sudden movement throwing off his balance, and he braced himself against the wall.</p>
                  <p>Or rather, it was a window, textured glass blocks stacked into a towering grid that spanned the height of the wall and stretched down the hallway. At the end of the window, there was a large, metal door with a digital sign above it. His stomach dropped, and he suddenly realized why he had felt so restless all morning. CVRS was enough to put him on edge, sure, but the familiar sight of the glowing red sign that read "In Session" made him realize he had been here before.</p>
                  <p>Albeit, he had been in Primary Care, but the distorted figures shuffling behind the warped glass elicited the same unease that he had felt back when he was a child. He had been on the other side of the glass, positioned squarely in the center of the room, all eyes on him.</p>
                  <p>He scrambled to distract himself with the paperwork, knowing full well if he indulged his memories any further, things would quickly spiral out of control. He bolted down the hall, quickly initialing each page without reading Rami's accounts. Rami was an observant person, he rationalized, certainly more observant than him. There was no sense in double-checking his work; he was Emory's primary Adjunct, after all.</p>
                  <p><em>You'll be done in less than 10 minutes, Daniel,</em> a staticky voice echoed in the back of his head. <em>We'll take good care of you.</em></p>
                  <p>His heart pounded against his ribcage; all he could hear was the deafening sound of his blood rushing through his veins. He picked up the pace, now power-walking down the corridor, sweat trickling down his tensed jaw. He scribbled his last initial, skipped over the section to add any additional observations, and stared at the final page. It was short, but had open-ended questions, each number highlighted. He grit his teeth and offered a few terse sentence fragments.</p>
                  <p>The large, metal door loomed behind him, its presence heavy and unwavering no matter how far back it was. His shoulders were stiff and his ears rang with a high-pitched squeal. Pinpricks of fear exploded across the back of his neck as he could feel its presence closing in on him. He was practically jogging, his throat stinging with bile.</p>
                  <p>He burst through the double doors of the waiting room with a slam, everyone turning to him in surprise. He forced a weak, apologetic smile as he shuffled to the front desk, his ears still ringing.</p>
                  <p>Kieran gave him a polite, cautious smile. "All done? I can take your packet."</p>
                  <p>He wordlessly handed it to her, steadying himself on the counter with a white-knuckled grip.</p>
                  <p>The amber lenses of her bifocals shimmered in the cold, fluorescent light as she quickly gave him a once-over. Her eyes narrowed suspiciously, but she quickly turned her attention back to the packet, skimming through to make sure nothing was missed. "Alright, you should be good to go."</p>
                  <p>He gave her an acknowledging nod and slipped out the door, patting his pockets for his cigarettes. His heart was still pounding, and his hands shook as he desperately raised his lighter.</p>
                  <p>The staticky voices and lingering alcohol smell haunted him as he tried to focus on everything around him. The birds, the cars, the wind in the trees. His cigarette smoke, the hot asphalt, the grease from a nearby fast food chain. He steadied himself against the concrete wall, but could feel himself slowly slipping down to his feet. His eyes began to lose focus.</p>
                  <p>To his right, the door to the adjoining Primary Care burst open and an enthusiastic voice began shouting at him, but it was muffled by the sharp ringing in his ears. A couple quick snaps in his face jarred him from his trance, and he looked up to see Emory, a plastic medical bracelet around their wrist.</p>
                  <p>"Hey, man! Havin' a crisis?" They extended their hand to help him to his feet. "Can't think of any other reason you'd be smokin' a cig on the dirty-ass sidewalk outside a CVRS."</p>
                  <p>He cautiously took their hand, nervously glancing around as he clambered to his feet. Emory gave him a few hearty back pats that seemed to jostle his brain enough to shake him out of his haze. He grumbled an incoherent string of complaints as he dragged his hand down his face and wordlessly offered Emory a cigarette.</p>
                  <p>"No thanks. But if you want to do me a favor, you could&mdash;"</p>
                  <p>"Why on earth would I want to do you a favor?"</p>
                  <p>"Um, hello? As an apology?"</p>
                  <p>Sometimes Emory's incomprehensible absurdity was a welcomed breath of fresh air. Hard to focus on his nausea when he was preoccupied trying to understand them. "For what?"</p>
                  <p>"Boy, are you in there?" They furiously snapped in his face, and he swatted them away. "My Branch, you dumbass!"</p>
                  <p>He shook his head as he rolled his eyes.</p>
                  <p>"No? What do you mean no?"</p>
                  <p>"I mean, you can't pin that whole thing on me. Plus, Rami ruled it a rogue Branch. So I'm off the hook."</p>
                  <p>"Two things can be true at once, do you know that? I stand by my claim that I wouldn't have even had that Branch if you weren't such an ass. Your hurtful words made me vulnerable to whatever antics my stupid Vice was trying to pull.</p>
                  <p>His eyes narrowed. He couldn't tell if they were being serious. As he said multiple times in the interview, he never had any idea what was going on in their head. They had a theatrical air about them, and that definitely wasn't something they would say without ulterior motives.</p>
                  <p>Emory continued, shooting him a smug look. "If you hadn't been an ass, I could've probably resisted it."</p>
                  <p>"I don't think that's how rogue Branches work."</p>
                  <p>"I'm curious. Are you capable of apologizing? Like at all?"</p>
                  <p>"I can apologize quite well when I actually have something to apologize for." The guilt he had felt during the interview had been replaced with mild annoyance. It was hard to apologize to the person who was rubbing it in his face, even if he was still a bit remorseful.</p>
                  <p>"You do realize you didn’t even ask me how I was feeling."</p>
                  <p>"You look plenty fine to me."</p>
                  <p>Emory blew him off with a dismissive hand gesture. "Fine, be a cunt, Whatever, man. If I can’t guilt an apology out of you, I’ll annoy something I want out of you instead." They rummaged around their jacket for their phone and pulled up a page, shoving it in his face.</p>
                  <p>Danny held it further away with a squint. It was a news article titled <em>CVRS Opens Investigation of Local Branch Hotspot</em>. The featured photo was the corner store, wrapped in yellow caution tape. He pushed it back towards them with a smirk. "Slow news day?"</p>
                  <p>"Really? No reaction?"</p>
                  <p>"I mean, I'm a little annoyed at not being able to go to my shift today. And kinda pissed Lucia didn't tell me. But I'm not <em>not</em> looking forward to spending the rest of my day in bed."</p>
                  <p>"You don't find this exciting at all?"</p>
                  <p>"Exciting? God, no. Weird, yeah. I mean, didn't Eli and Frankie just do a walkthrough? What the heck do they plan on finding?"</p>
                  <p>"That's the exciting part!"</p>
                  <p>"Sounds like an excuse to waste time to me, but who am I to judge. I once found a way to wipe down a counter for three hours."</p>
                  <p>"Oh, come on. You aren't the least bit curious about what they might find? I did some reading while I was in Primary Care, you know." They whipped out a rolled collection of papers.</p>
                  <p>"Oh," Danny perked up. "Did you finally ask a VMS for an official copy?"</p>
                  <p>With a chuffed grin, they unfurled it to reveal that it was, in fact, an updated copy of the Vice Research Compendium, but it was still an agent's copy, their name and ID in the top left corner.</p>
                  <p>He dragged his hand down his face. "Unbelievable. How did you even have time to steal someone's copy while you were in there? There's something wrong with you."</p>
                  <p>Emory ignored him. "This new version has <em>tons</em> of neat shit. There's new classifications, and they even introduced subclasses, and there's so much more information about Branches a-and all that stuff! Lots of new stuff about Vice biology, too!" They were enthusiastically jostling the compendium as they rambled on. "And I found out a lot of the notes I'd jotted down as theories in my old copy were actually right! And that's where things get really interesting! I'd done some thinking based on some observations I came across a few months ago. Did you know Vices can make these things called repos that&mdash;"</p>
                  <p>"Emory. Please. Not right now." Orange safety cones draped with caution tape came into view as they approached the store. There was an uneasiness churning deep in his stomach. Emory had done a good job of distracting him, but the budding nausea was getting harder to ignore. His forehead was clammy and his throat, tight. The closer he got to home, the more he wanted to be buried under at least four blankets.</p>
                  <p>"What do you mean <em>not right now?</em> If you're not gonna apologize, you could at least indulge me and listen to me ramble a bit."</p>
                  <p>"At the expense of my sanity?"</p>
                  <p>"Oh, come on. You're always so damn dramatic. Let me gush about repos and we'll call it even. This stuff's super interesting."</p>
                  <p>"I don't even know what that is, so I can't agree or disagree."</p>
                  <p>"Cool, I'll tell you about them, then. They're pretty rare, but sometimes when a Vice is mature, it can make a big hulking mass of flesh&mdash;"</p>
                  <p>"No. <em>Hell</em> no, Emory. Not today. Not ever." A pang of nausea urged a rush of heat over his ears. "How about I buy you a beer or something instead? Later, though. I need to go lay down for a bit."</p>
                  <p>"Or..." Emory trailed off as they skipped over to the cones and playfully gestured to the door. "You could unlock the store for me and I'll leave you alone."</p>
                  <p>"Why do you want in there? There's nothing to look at! How much could have possibly changed between now and yesterday?"</p>
                  <p>"I dunno! That's what I wanna find out! If I don't find anything in like 15 minutes, I'll probably get bored and run off anyway, don't worry."</p>
                  <p>"I take it you see the caution tape but are just electing to ignore it?"</p>
                  <p>"Like this means anything." They tore a strip from the door and balled it up in their hands. "What is there even to be cautious of, you know?"</p>
                  <p>"Well, for one, the last time you were in there you had a rogue Branch."</p>
                  <p>"Oh? Is that a theory I hear?"</p>
                  <p>"Absolutely not. I'm just saying it doesn't seem terribly smart. And I mean, what if I open the door and the agents are in there? I don't wanna get in trouble, too."</p>
                  <p>"What, you scared?"</p>
                  <p>"No, I just can't be bothered. I've had enough CVRS bullshit today."</p>
                  <p>"Ah, whatever. They're probably not even in there, anyway. I can guarantee you, if there are any agents around, they're taking an absurdly long smoke break in the back alley." Emory squished their face against the tinted glass. "See? The lights are off."</p>
                  <p>The two nearly jumped out of their shoes as the front door chimed, ripping the caution tape and shoving the safety cones out of the way. Frankie poked her head out with a blank expression.</p>
                  <p>"You do understand what caution tape means, don't you?" She gestured to the CVRS-branded sign taped to the door. "We even added a sign in case it wasn't clear."</p>
                  <p>Emory confidently planted their hands on their hips, but their voice was shaky. "Y-yeah, we're just nosy..."</p>
                  <p>"Glad to see you got out of Primary Care so quickly," Frankie nodded, "but I'm going to have to ask you leave. You, on the other hand," she turned to Danny, "we didn't think to ask for indoor keys. Could you open a few doors for us?"</p>
                  <p>His shoulders deflated, nausea creeping back up his throat. His pained grimace must have alluded to his reservation.</p>
                  <p>"I understand it's technically your day off, but it will be quick. We will compensate you for your efforts, as well."</p>
                  <p>"What!" Emory practically levitated off the ground. "He gets money for unlocking some doors? How's that fair?"</p>
                  <p>"It's quite fair, actually," she began flatly. "We have commandeered his place of employment; therefore, he will not be paid for today. On top of that, I'm asking him to perform a task for me. The least I could do is compensate him for it."</p>
                  <p>"God, you have an answer for everything, don't you?"</p>
                  <p>"Generally." Frankie gestured for Danny to follow her inside, to which he audibly protested, but complied nonetheless.</p>
                  <p>Emory threw themself at the door as it slammed shut, pressing their entire person against the glass as they watched the two converse.</p>
                  <p>Danny nervously thumbed through his keys. "Um...just you today?"</p>
                  <p>"No, Eli is checking the exterior in the back alley." She flipped down her safety glasses and began looking around.</p>
                  <p>"Oh, okay. Cool." He tried to come off as casually as he could, but his hands were practically shaking as he opened Lucia's office. "Um, the bathrooms should be unlocked, so that just leaves the st&mdash;"</p>
                  <p>Frankie threw out her arm, nearly folding Danny in half. The force from her block urged a very convincing gag that required all of his concentration to suppress. She quickly sent a message with her MobiComm, then pulled a VGMeter from her pocket.</p>
                  <p>"What's wr&mdash;"</p>
                  <p>"Does this look any different to you?" She pointed to the storage room.</p>
                  <p>He cocked his head at the off-white door, sitting crooked in its threshold with chipped paint and splintered wood. He pursed his lips. "No? Is something wrong?"</p>
                  <p>"We cleared this room, correct?"</p>
                  <p>"You used a...one of those flash bang things, yeah, I remember."</p>
                  <p>The back door clicked open and Eli jogged into the room, flushed from the summer heat. Even behind his sunglasses, it was hard to hide his delighted surprise. "Oh! Hey, Danny! Everything alright, Frankie?"</p>
                  <p>She gestured to the storage room. "We cleared this with an AVCharge less than 48 hours ago and look at the state of it. I haven't seen a density like that since the...well, I'm actually not sure I've ever seen a density of that caliber."</p>
                  <p>He turned around, and his shoulders stiffened. "Oh, wow."</p>
                  <p>Danny's curiosity was overpowered by his incredibly strong desire to get out of there as quickly as possible. All he had to do was unlock the storage room, and he had fulfilled his duty. His bed was mere minutes away. To him, it was the same storage room that had been there since his first day, the same storage room he had opened dozens of times.</p>
                  <p>But to Eli and Frankie, it was something else entirely, an anomaly, an unknown. Through their orange lenses, the door shone dazzlingly bright, bleeding a fierce, hot light into the frame around it. The solid white pulsed and throbbed like the rise and fall of steady breath and burned a perfect replica into their retinas.</p>
                  <p>Eli turned over his shoulder as Danny approached with the key. His calm facade dropped for a moment, fear washing over his pallid face. Dense, white tendrils branched from Danny's stomach, snaking throughout and across his body like a compact, mycelial system.</p>
                  <p>Danny's hand stopped inches from the door. Sharp ringing pierced through his ears as a dense pressure forced itself against his temples and teased his balance. A thin stream of blood dripped from his nose and infiltrated the corner of his mouth with a pointed, metallic tang. He could feel the floor slipping out from under his feet.</p>
                  <p>"Danny?" Eli reached for him, his eyes wide in terror.</p>
                  <p>Frankie whipped her arm behind him as he tumbled backwards, falling against it with a guttural cough that sputtered black muck from his lips.</p>
                  <p>He lurched forward and stumbled to the ground as sludge was thrust from the depths of his stomach. A pair of hands consoled his trembling shoulders, but felt like knives against his skin. Voices were muffled by the pressure building in his ears. A clot worked its way up his throat and fell from his mouth with a nauseating squelch.</p>
                  <p>Frankie towered above him as Eli joined him on the floor, rubbing his back and offering feeble attempts at consolation between looking up at her with desperate pleas. Her eyes were locked on Danny, wide and frenzied, because below, through her amber lenses, Danny was heaving viscous globs of liquid light down his chin, an immaculate stream of glittering stardust pooling at his knees.</p>
                  <p>Shakily, Eli pointed at the clot of tar seeping across the floor tiles. "I-Is that moving?"</p>
                  <p>Frankie brought her foot down with a powerful stomp, obliterating the writhing pile of sludge into a hissing miasma around her Cleansing Boot. She grabbed Danny by the wrist and whipped him up to his feet as he coughed a dart of black across her cheek.</p>
                  <p>"W-w-wait, wait, wait!" His voice was garbled by the muck still trapped in his throat. "I'm okay, I'm okay. I just need a minute."</p>
                  <p>"That is not okay." She pointed sternly at the seeping puddle of sludge beneath them. "I've never seen blights like this, and I've been doing this for 15 years. Let alone a network that dense. How did I not notice this before?"</p>
                  <p>Danny leaned away and hacked a glob of tar onto the floor, not unlike a cat dislodging a hairball.</p>
                  <p>"We're taking you to Urgent Care," Frankie stated simply, clicking away at her MobiComm. "Agitated blights of this severity must be addressed immediately."</p>
                  <p>"Don't really see the point. M'done now," he slurred, dizzied by the pressure in his ears finally equalizing. "S'all good."</p>
                  <p>Eli sharply whispered behind his hand. "Do it or Frankie will drag you there herself."</p>
                  <p>"I will not take no for an answer." She turned to him then paused, no longer able to see the dense network of tendrils. Faint wisps of light remained in various areas, likely where the tendrils converged. Eventually it pulsed out of sight, not a trace left behind.</p>
                  <p>Eli pulled his arm up to his face to inspect it, flipping his sunglasses up and down repeatedly. "Where did it go?"</p>
                  <p>Frankie hummed to herself. "Omicron subclass. Typically indicative of a Vice with elevated intelligence. All the more reason to get him to Urgent Care."</p>
                  <p>"I'm fine, it's all good, I promise," Danny insisted. "I've just had a long day. This really isn't out of character for me. I already spent time in Urgent Care for the Branch Recovery interview this morning, and that's probably what did it. That aligns with part of my Branch Ops. Just a delayed reaction. I really don't want to go back."</p>
                  <p>"Fine. Then you'll go to Primary Care."</p>
                  <p>He let out a protesting whine, and Eli squeezed his arm, shooting him a whisper. "I know you're stubborn, but you can't out-stubborn Frankie. Just do it."</p>
                  <p>He relented begrudgingly, tripping over his feet as he headed for the exit. Eli caught up behind him and threw his arm around his shoulder, hoisting him up. His shorter frame struggled with Danny's gangly and unwieldy physique. Frankie loomed behind them, searing her gaze into the back of his neck. Emory was nowhere to be found.</p>
