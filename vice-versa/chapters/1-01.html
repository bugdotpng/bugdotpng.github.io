                    <p>It was another unremarkable evening at the corner store. The air conditioner rattled as it struggled against the damp heat seeping through the gaps in the doors, and a stale funk permeated the air. A lone customer wandered to the back of the store, while Danny, the one employee on duty, sat behind the counter compulsively refreshing various social media feeds. Mundane, low-energy shifts like these were exactly why he took the job, but even he was the first to admit things were unnaturally calm for a Tuesday evening at the tail end of rush hour. Never in his adult life had he worked somewhere that had such abysmal foot traffic, but it hadn't always been like this. About four months ago started a steady decline in customers, and employees soon began following suit, either quitting without notice or taking unpaid sick leave for disturbingly long migraine episodes and bouts of the stomach flu. It left the store empty and lifeless, and even unsettling at times.</p>
                    <p>Still, he resisted yearning for a little excitement. The last time he fantasized about having something interesting happen at work, the parking lot was crawling with CVRS agents, and he spent the majority of his shift having to repeatedly give his account to every agent who made eye contact with him. There were only so many ways he could say he didn't see much. With that, he learned to appreciate the slower evenings, so he kicked back and tried to embrace the tranquility.</p>
                    <p>He watched as the single customer aimlessly sauntered along the back aisle and fanned at his flushed face, likely from the humidity smothering the store like a wet blanket despite the air conditioner's best efforts. He took his time studying the drinks behind the glass doors, moving from one panel to the other. He slowed as time ticked by, eventually coming to a complete stop in the middle of the aisle, still no drinks in hand. Danny drew in a deep breath as his eyes grew heavy. Maybe just a little excitement wouldn't hurt.</p>
                    <p>The door suddenly flew open, sending the bell above it into a clamor and causing Danny to fumble his phone to the ground. A bulky olive utility jacket backed into the store, followed by a scruffy, cascading mane of fire-red hair. The figure was hunched over, intently studying a trail of who-knows-what on the ground.</p>
                    <p>His shoulders fell with a sigh. "Emory," he muttered in begrudging acknowledgement. He figured that was what he deserved for daring to dream of a little excitement. Emory was certainly the epitome of such, known even outside of their friend group as a whirlwind of unbridled chaos and obscenity.</p>
                    <p>"Well, well, well!" They shot upright and pushed a pair of orange-tinted goggles up their forehead. An unsightly red ring from the rubber cups of their goggles circled their lively brown eyes. "What are the odds I'd wind up at the store again!"</p>
                    <p>He raised his brows tauntingly. "Summoned by the wretched vibes again?"</p>
                    <p>"Technically, yeah, but I could do without the sarcasm." They turned up their nose.</p>
                    <p>The two had known each other since high school, but it was only within the last few months that Emory started making regular appearances at the store. They claimed they had a sixth sense when it came to Vices&mdash;fleshy, parasitic creatures embedded in the innards of roughly 62% of the population. A phenomenon called a "Branch" was the disorienting and occasionally deadly side effect of having this sentient tumor throbbing in your viscera. And supposedly, Emory could sense these Branches before they began, many of which seemed to be happening in the store as of late. Though Danny more so believed they just wandered around aimlessly until they stumbled upon one.</p>
                    <p>"Sure you're in the right place? Business isn't exactly booming tonight." He gestured to the single customer, still at the back of the store.</p>
                    <p>"Just because <em>you're</em> not busy doesn't mean something's not getting stirred up around here. This is a big building; could be someone in the pawn shop next door, could be one of your neighbors in the apartments upstairs, could even be you." They planted their hands on their hips with a scoff, "I mean, don't you find it the teensiest bit odd I got called here again?"</p>
                    <p>"Called? I didn't realize the vibes had cellular."</p>
                    <p>"You know what I mean, jackass."</p>
                    <p>"Emory, you're talking like this is your job and you're here on official duty. I'm shocked you haven't been reported yet."</p>
                    <p>"For <em>what?"</em></p>
                    <p>"Impersonating a Target Hunter."</p>
                    <p>"Pfft!" They rolled their eyes and blew him off with a scoff. "S'not like I'm running around with a fake badge or anything."</p>
                    <p>"I don't know why you insist on doing this on your own. Rami's told you he could get you a job with CVRS. Public Deployment is understaffed anyway, so they're probably desperate. You'd get paid much better than the wimpy stipends they give out for civilian intervention."</p>
                    <p>Knowing Emory since they were kids, Rami had spent the better half of his limited free time corralling them, especially the older they got. Whether it was pulling them out of the CVRS dumpster or bailing them out for trespassing government property, Rami was there for cleanup duty. He was regularly trying to find a positive way for Emory to burn off their seemingly endless energy reserves that didn't involve him mediating confrontations, and a job with their Public Deployment team would satisfy the need nicely. Evident by the fact that Emory had been cosplaying as a Target Hunter for the last year or so.</p>
                    <p>"It's not about the money." They turned their head with an irritated huff. "I do this because I enjoy it, <em>and</em> I'm good at it! I don't wanna play by their stuffy rules. It'd cramp my style."</p>
                    <p>"Either way, Rami said to cut it out. It'd be a shame if he found out you were still running around doing all this after y'all's last spat."</p>
                    <p>Emory's face fell into a scowl. "What, are you gonna tell on me? Thought you didn't care about this stuff. What good does tattling do for you?"</p>
                    <p>Danny, in fact, did not care. It was half one dozen of the other to him if Emory decided to pursue a reputable career or run around the city like some sort of vigilante gremlin meddling in people's lives. What he didn't appreciate was how often they brought up the topic of Vices or CVRS, especially when he used to be able to go weeks without thinking too much about any of it&mdash;even with CVRS right down the street. "It'd cut down on your impromptu visits, that's for sure."</p>
                    <p>"They're not <em>impromptu</em>. There's an art to this, you know. Regardless, this store alone has had&hellip;" they muttered to themselves as they counted on their fingers, "&hellip;eight rogue Branches in the last four months&mdash;nine if this call doesn't end up being a dud&mdash;so something weird's gotta be going on here. Something about this area keeps triggering them, because Lucia said y'all hadn't had a Branch here in years before all this started up."</p>
                    <p>"Keep that to yourself, alright? Lucia's already stressed about sales and not having anyone to work shifts. The last thing she needs to be worried about is some&hellip;" he wiggled his fingers vaguely, "&hellip;weird Vice bullshit."</p>
                    <p>As the store owner, Lucia had worked herself into so much of a frenzy over the lack of sales the night before that she woke up with a migraine and had Danny run the show for the day, as if anyone else was left on the roster or there was even a show to run. The poor woman was running herself ragged trying to keep up with it all.</p>
                    <p>"It's not uncommon for things like that to be linked, you know." Emory flipped their hair behind their shoulder. "And I've already talked about it with her. She agrees with me!"</p>
                    <p>"What, that something weird is going on? She's been saying that for months. That's not exactly a revelation."</p>
                    <p>"No, she agrees something's <em>causing</em> all of this!"</p>
                    <p>"Oh, come on. That's getting a little conspiratorial. What's your theory? That some big bad is hiding in the shadows, making our employees sick and bonking customers on the head with a magic Branch-inducing mallet?"</p>
                    <p>"Of course not. But it's all gotta be linked, you know? I mean, what are the odds Lucia's barely able to keep the store afloat while y'all have had more Branches in four months than there have been for the store's entire operation?"</p>
                    <p>"I dunno what to tell ya. Shit happens."</p>
                    <p>Emory scoffed. "And you made fun of <em>my</em> theory."</p>
                    <p>"It's not my &lsquo;theory' because I don't think anything weird's going on. I just think things are cyclical and sometimes life just sucks. It's a lot more productive to accept that than think something's up every time things don't go your way. The universe is a cold and uncaring place. Sometimes a shitty little corner store ends up with eight Branches in four months and a sharp decline in sales. Life is just unfair like that sometimes."</p>
                    <p>"You were an emo kid, weren't you? I think I remember Gen telling me that."</p>
                    <p>He waved them off with a groan. "Go tend to the public's Vices or whatever. You're giving me a headache."</p>
                    <p>"Careful!" They waggled their finger. "If the store loses you, it'll definitely have to close."</p>
                    <p>"A headache, not a migraine. A tension headache, specifically. From clenching my jaw. Because of you. Now&hellip;" He gestured vaguely to the empty store. "Off you go."</p>
                    <p>"I don't have to be here, you know." They planted their hands on their hips with a scowl. "If you think about it, I'm actually doing you a favor."</p>
                    <p>"I don't think you <em>should</em> be here, actually. I think what you're doing is reckless and unnecessary. And, you know what? I actually think you're parading around as a fake Target Hunter because you have some deep-rooted issues you refuse to address."</p>
                    <p>"Well, thank god no one asked what you think."</p>
                    <p>They donned a pair of tattered fingerless gloves pulled from their jacket pocket and slipped their goggles back down over their eyes. Both were CVRS-issued articles given to agents after completing training, though these in particular were fished out of the dumpster in the back alley. The gloves were torn and the lenses of the goggles were cracked, but Emory didn't seem inhibited by their minor defects.</p>
                    <p>Their goggles revealed a field of fuzzy, white particles hanging in the air around them, gently swaying with their movements. "Oh, see? Something has to be up. There's always a lot of these, uh&hellip;these things out before a Branch."</p>
                    <p>Danny knew what they were, but he kept it to himself, lest he reveal he knew more about Vices than he let on. Anything he had learned was against his will, either from past CVRS visits or Gen and Rami, and he knew a lot, but he tried not to think about it. The reminder there was a parasitic, throbbing mass embedded in his innards was enough to trigger a nausea spell alone, hence his growing frustration with Emory's repeated visits.</p>
                    <p>"Welp, I think I might do a lap and see what all the fuss is about." They took a single step forward before they froze and whipped their head around their shoulder. "Wait, do you smell that?"</p>
                    <p>"You're not the first person to mention it. I'll put out an air freshener t&mdash;"</p>
                    <p>"No, no, not the funk. It's something else." Emory held up a quieting finger as they sniffed the air curiously. They continued in a hushed tone, "You really don't smell that?"</p>
                    <p>He hunched his shoulders and leaned toward them, surprised by their seriousness. "Not really. Why are we whispering?" he whispered back.</p>
                    <p>A sudden tugging pulled at the soles of his feet, and he stumbled forward, catching himself on the counter. He winced as the pressure shifted in his head, a high-pitched ring tearing through his ears.</p>
                    <p>Their face lit up. "Oh! Did you feel something?" The tug at the heels of their combat boots verified their suspicions, and they nearly elevated off the floor in excitement. "Oh, hell yeah! I <em>knew</em> I was in the right place! It's Branch time, baby!"</p>
                    <p>"E-Emory, seriously? Don't make me go through this again." He tried to pull back from the magnetic pull that pressed his legs against the counter. He looked past them to meet the eyes of the young man at the back of the store, his head limply thrown over his shoulder with his pupils wide and face pallid as a single, pointed horn tore through his forehead and patches of scales erupted from the soft flesh of his arms. The Host's chest hitched erratically as a liquid gurgling in his throat masked his desperate plea. Danny swallowed dryly, unable to pull his eyes away. His face was equally as pale as he weakly stammered out, "A-a-are you really sure you should be doing this?" No matter how many times he witnessed it, he would never get used to it.</p>
                    <p>"Oh, I'm <em>so</em> sure." They locked eyes with the Host. "I've got this down to a minute. Time me."</p>
                    <p>Emory drove their heel against the floor, and a bright flash of light pulsed from their bandaged knee, shooting a beam into the air above them. It expanded and morphed into a baseball bat in a burst of bright cyan. The details were soft, and its form was fluid, but it was undeniably a baseball bat, transparent, pulsing, and glowing.</p>
                    <p>They tightened their hands around the grip with a confidence born from repeated practice. Beads of light warped around their palms, and small beams of light shot from between their fingers. They threw their bat over their shoulder and bolted down the aisle with unwavering conviction.</p>
                    <p>Danny tried to ignore the tightening lump of disgust in his throat, but the magnetic pull of a Branch Staging was one that rivaled the morbid fascination of watching a train wreck. It was practically impossible to look away, no matter how much he wanted to. The last thing he wanted to see was Emory's Branch Suspension tactics in action for the umpteenth time, but he was forced to watch, fearfully gripping the countertop as if he were going to be pulled right in.</p>
                    <p>Emory lunged toward the Host, their eyes wide with a wild, fiery frenzy. With a ferocious swing, the pulsing barrel smashed against his cheek in a brilliant burst of light. A clear, viscous goop shot from his mouth and hissed against the linoleum as he stumbled back, clattering against the glass doors. Emory drove the top of the bat into his gut, and a wet, miserable cough heaved dribbles of goop down his chin.</p>
                    <p>One more smack against his other cheek was all it took for the Host to fall to the ground in a shallow puddle of the bubbling slime that oozed from his slack lips and unresponsive eyes. Emory raised a victorious fist, pumping their bat into the air before it warped out of sight in a bright flash of sparkling light. "Danny! How long was that?"</p>
                    <p>He cautiously emerged from behind the counter, the pressure in his head equalizing as the light tug against his heels faded. "I-I don't know. I wasn't timing." He covered his mouth with gag.</p>
                    <p>"Gah, I told you to time me! I'm getting really good at this!"</p>
                    <p>"Clearly," he muttered as he approached the Host lying unconscious in a puddle of hissing goo. It appeared to be some sort of corrosive substance, having already eaten through the linoleum tiles. The horn had receded to a small knot on his forehead, and the patches of scales were starting to slough off, but the acid continued dribbling from his lips. No blights were pleasant, but the expulsion of acid seemed particularly uncomfortable and inconvenient, the thought of it urging bile up his throat. "The magical bat seems a tad overkill," he burped.</p>
                    <p>"Listen, I earned this Patch. It's only fair that I use it for its intended purpose. Plus, most of &lsquo;em don't put up much of a fight when I whip that bad boy out. Don't wanna risk things getting outta hand or accidentally getting pulled in as an adjunct."</p>
                    <p>The scene reeked of sour milk as the fluid seemed to dissipate into thin air, its pungent fumes warping the drink shelves behind them. Danny pulled his collar up over his nose. "Sure we should be inhaling this stuff?"</p>
                    <p>"Ah, it ain't gonna hurtchya. Not any more than huffing bleach in your bathroom would, if I had to guess." They gestured toward the man with a nod. "Well? You gonna help me?"</p>
                    <p>"Help you with what?"</p>
                    <p>"I only Suspended it. Help me get him to Urgent Care so CVRS can take care of it."</p>
                    <p>"I'd really rather not." He grimaced as he tightened his arms around his uneasy stomach. "You know I can't stand this stuff. I think I've had my share for tonight. Or a month."</p>
                    <p>"Ah, yeah? Would you rather me leave him here and wait for it to come back?"</p>
                    <p>"What's the rush? I mean, why don't we just call CVRS to come take care of things?"</p>
                    <p>"Listen man, I don't know anything about these people's Vices. I only Suspended it, so who knows how quickly it'll come back!"</p>
                    <p>Danny's jaw tightened. "You know, I've been meaning to ask. Why are you running around doing this when you don't know anything about these people?" Suspension, in his experience, wasn't particularly easy to recover from and usually gave him lingering symptoms for weeks. Their blas&eacute; attitude and lack of preparation in their approach was something he couldn't even fathom, and he questioned the efficacy of their tactics if he were ever in the Host's position. "You don't know how these things could retaliate! Not just against you, but against the Host!"</p>
                    <p>"I stopped the damn thing! What's your damage?"</p>
                    <p>"I'm just thinking that if I were in his situation, would&mdash;"</p>
                    <p>"Oh, of <em>course</em> you're thinking of yourself and not the unconscious guy laying in a puddle of acid."</p>
                    <p>"You're the one who made him unconscious! My god, Emory. I really cannot understand why you don't just leave this to the professionals!"</p>
                    <p>They threw out their arms and gestured theatrically at the empty store around them. "See any professionals? I Suspend the Branches the professionals don't know about. That's my whole schtick! Better than risking my life <em>and</em> the Host's by trying to Commit it! Is that what you want?"</p>
                    <p>"You don't think it's risky beating them into unconsciousness with a magical baseball bat?"</p>
                    <p>"Better than the alternative! Would you rather get smacked around a few times and have a sore neck for a few days or have a sentient alien tumor take over your body and explode you into a million billion pieces?" They shrugged their shoulders as if the answer was obvious.</p>
                    <p>"Guh&mdash;quit! Just stop. I hate thinking about that." Danny squeezed his eyes shut and hid behind his hands. "Just take your Suspended Host and get out of here, please!"</p>
                    <p>They silently gestured to the body again, looking at him like he was stupid.</p>
                    <p>He threw his hands up in exasperation. "What? What do you want from me?"</p>
                    <p>"He's too tall! I can't carry him!"</p>
                    <p>"And?"</p>
                    <p>"Carry him! To CVRS! Firefighter style, bridal style, whatever you fancy. Just don't drag &lsquo;em. Did that once and got the cops called on me."</p>
                    <p>"What would you do if I wasn't here?"</p>
                    <p>"Does that matter? You're here now!"</p>
                    <p>"It <em>does</em> matter, because I don't want to do this!"</p>
                    <p>Their voices overlapped as their volume grew louder. Arguing with either of them was like arguing with a brick wall; Emory, because they didn't hear you half the time, and Danny, because he was stubborn as a mule. Usually. Emory had a grating way of wearing him down, powered by a seemingly endless supply of totally unadulterated absurdity. After a while, he didn't even know what he was arguing about anymore. The Host spit up a glob of acid.</p>
                    <p>"God, fine." He ran his hands down his face with a dramatic groan. "I'll do it, but I'm not happy about it, and I'm going to complain the whole time. <em>And</em> I'm telling Gen and Rami you held a knife to my throat. I'm hoping it's in character enough for you that they don't bother to fact check." He bent down and inspected the puddle of acid with a crinkled frown. "Are you <em>sure</em> this stuff's okay to touch?"</p>
                    <p>"I suppose there's only one way to find out.</p>
                    <p>"You know I took this job to avoid this kind of stuff, right?"</p>
                    <p>"Well, jokes on you. Seems like there's something about this building that the Vices get riled up about. Maybe it's the hot chips." They grabbed a bag from the endcap. "These are hard to find, you know."</p>

                    <span class="divider divider--long">/////</span>

                    <p>The Center for Vice Research and Support (CVRS) had hundreds of stations across the state. Most large cities had at least 10, some within a few miles of each other. They were large, lifeless corporate buildings that spanned entire streets and towered over apartment complexes, most of which were regarded as eyesores by the general population. Each station housed three specialized teams in addition to research offices, so they were often regarded as maze-like and unwelcoming to laypeople.</p>
                    <p>Thankfully, the Urgent Care facet was fairly straightforward, being a public-facing entity. The revolving door led straight into the waiting room, where Emory and Danny were met with an amused smile from Kieran, the Intake Coordinator. She was a fastidious young woman who was familiar with Emory's antics, having been their primary point of contact now for over a year.</p>
                    <p>"Again?" She peered over her computer screen and sighed at the dripping, unresponsive body awkwardly cradled in Danny's arms and loosely bundled in a plastic tarp. She adjusted orange-tinted bifocals on the bridge of her nose as she quickly scanned the body and began typing her observations into the system. She deliberately paused her typing to shoot Emory a stern look before she entered their contact information, now having it memorized. "Another Suspension, I presume?"</p>
                    <p>Emory confidently puffed out their chest. "Yup, same ol', same ol'. Found him at the corner store down the street again. He didn't put up much of a fight, and his blights weren't all that inflamed. Let's see, there was a horn on the forehead, scales on the arms, and some kind of acid stuff coming out of him. Hence the tarp."</p>
                    <p>She quickly documented Emory's account, scanning the Host again, then glancing up at Danny, who was nervously shifting his weight. "And what was your role in this?"</p>
                    <p>"O-oh, just ignore me. I don't want to be here."</p>
                    <p>"He's just helping me carry the Host." Emory waved him off. "I did all the work, though."</p>
                    <p>"I see," Kieran smiled to herself as she wrapped up the admission paperwork. "The Floor Manager will be here to initiate intake shortly. In the meantime&hellip;" She flipped her glasses down and raised her brows, "...how in the world do you keep coming across these Hosts?"</p>
                    <p>They cracked their knuckles and casually leaned against the counter. "Just got a knack for it, I guess. I was just out and about and had a gut feeling something was up. I like to think I'm pretty observant and perceptive."</p>
                    <p>She perched her elbows on the counter and rested her chin on her hands. "Well, aren't you somethin'," she teased.</p>
                    <p>Emory's cheeks tinted pink as their elbow nearly slipped off the counter. "Hey, so, uh&hellip;Is Rami running the floor tonight?"</p>
                    <p>"He is. And if I remember correctly, he told you to stop playing Target Hunter. Correct?"</p>
                    <p>"And?" They brushed off their shoulders with a scoff. "You really think he's capable of scolding people? Effectively, I mean. He's got the backbone of an overcooked spaghetti noodle."</p>
                    <p>She chuckled to herself as the doors exuberantly flew open beside her. In walked a large, enthusiastic man with a charmingly fluffy beard and dazzling smile. His white lab coat fluttered behind him as he strolled to the middle of the room, carrying a welcomed wave of bergamont with him. He hurriedly flipped through his clipboard, twirling a pen between his fingers as he skimmed the admission notes.</p>
                    <p>"Alrighty, we're ready for an Em&mdash;wait, Emory?" He threw his hands up in exasperation as his eyes caught them sheepishly hiding behind their jacket. "What did I tell you about&mdash;a-and Danny? Oh my god&mdash;uh, why are you, of all people, carrying the patient?"</p>
                    <p>Danny adjusted said patient with a grunt. "Speaking of, can you please take him? I think the acid's getting through the tarp."</p>
                    <p>"Right, right. Come on back!" He opened the doors and ushered them to follow. "We're packed tonight, but I've got all my Triage Specialists helping out. I can take care of y'all really quick."</p>
                    <p>Emory gave Danny a couple convincing shoves, and he stumbled forward hesitantly. "I-I'd really rather n&mdash;"</p>
                    <p>"It'll be quick! Just set him down right here," Rami patted the hospital bed and began flipping on various machines. "I'll just need you to fill out a report, and&mdash;"</p>
                    <p>"O-oh, no. No need to do that." The familiar beeps of medical monitors, the metallic clicking of old hospital bed wheels, and the hurried voices of agents took him to a place he didn't want to be. It was hard for him to think. A light flutter in his chest urged beads of sweat on his brow. "I just carried the body. Emory handled it. They can fill out the report."</p>
                    <p>Rami shot Emory a nasty look, who was hiding behind Danny's absurdly tall frame. "I'll deal with you in a minute," he threatened, then looked up at Danny with an apologetic smile. "Well, it's still protocol to gather reports from any available witnesses. It'll only take a few minutes. Unless you got pulled in as adjuncts. Then we might be here a while. But if I know Emory's methods at all&mdash;"</p>
                    <p>Danny awkwardly shed the patient from his arms and he rolled onto the bed with a lifeless thud. Rami adjusted the small, round glasses perched on his nose. They were tinted amber, much like Emory's goggles and Kieran's bifocals. He wrinkled his nose. "Yep, that's a Suspension if I've ever seen one."</p>
                    <p>Dense, glowing white splatters painted the patient's body, primarily smeared across his face where the acid continued to trickle out. A fuzzy white haze hung around his mouth as the acid sizzled against his skin, but didn't corrode. His face was gradually returning color, with a couple red welts where Emory's magical bat had made contact with his skin. It was a wonder those were all the injuries he left with, and not a broken neck.</p>
                    <p>Without the pungent fumes of acid dominating Danny's nostrils, he could smell the trademark CVRS fragrance of rubbing alcohol. A familiar uneasiness began to churn deep in his stomach. "I really just wanna get out of here. I did my good deed for the day."</p>
                    <p>Rami relented with a polite sigh as he began hooking the patient up to various beeping machines and wiping him down with a cloth. "Fair enough. I know you don't like this stuff, but you missed work for this, right? I'll fill it out for you so you at least get a stipend. Feel free to stay in the waiting room. It'll only be a minute."</p>
                    <p>"Why's he getting a stipend? I did all the work!" Danny could hear Emory cry as he quickly turned on his heel and sped for the door.</p>
                    <p>"Is that why you keep doing this?" Rami sighed with exasperation. "This isn't financially sustainable at all!"</p>
                    <p>Their budding argument faded as Danny made a bee-line for the exit. He gave Kieran a cordial nod as he blew through the waiting room, then stepped outside and took a deep breath.</p>
                    <p>His shoulders slumped with a dramatic exhale as he clambered down to take a seat on the curb. His nausea was catching up with him, and as much as he would've preferred to head home&mdash;the stipend wasn't nearly enough to convince him to stay&mdash;he was afraid any more steps would have urged a very convincing gag.</p>
                    <p>The stinging scent of rubbing alcohol still lingered in his nostrils, and he dragged his hands down his face with a miserable groan. Just the slightest whiff was able to launch his parasympathetic nervous system into survival mode. He inhaled deeply, hoping the breaths of not-so-fresh city air were enough to fend off the oncoming nausea spell.</p>
                    <p>There wasn't much that could help anymore, short of spending hours swaddled under a pile of 3 blankets, minimum. Food, one of his greatest comforts, was clearly out of the question. Ironically enough, the alcohol swabs that had been originally used to sooth his perpetually uneasy stomach as a child were now one of the worst offenders. The nurses claimed the scent was strong enough to distract the brain and interrupt the nausea, but it only worked for him the first couple of times.</p>
                    <p>He had gotten particularly skilled at warding off these episodes, but only if he had the luxury of being under his covers. Just three nights ago, he was able to prevent an episode by distracting himself with cooking videos, soft blankets, and sweet, musky candles. So long as he was at home, he could get ahead of it and prevent it from spiraling into a full-blown barf fest. But as it turned out, he wasn't home, and even though the humid summer air felt like a blanket, it just wasn't cutting it.</p>
                    <p>Rami hopped out from the revolving door, waving a thin slip of paper. "Danny! I've got your&mdash;o-oh no." His shoulders withered with pity as he watched Danny brace himself over the trashcan and heave his stomach contents into the bin. "Do I need to check you in?"</p>
                    <p>Danny offered a dismissive wave before returning to the bin to continue his compulsive retching.</p>
                    <p>"Well, once you're done I've got your stipend."</p>
                    <p>Emory squeezed their way out the door with a huff. "I still don't think it's fair his is the same as mine."</p>
                    <p>"It's not like the stipends are that much to begin with. You're gonna look at this pathetic wet-paper-towel-of-a-man and deny him even just a little compensation for helping out tonight? Poor guy could've just gone home and watched his cooking shows and now he's barfing in a public trash can because you looped him into your shenanigans again."</p>
                    <p>"I didn't loop him into anything! The Branch just so happened to have been at the store again! And if I hadn't done anything, he and the Host would've been dead!"</p>
                    <p>Rami rolled his eyes. "Oh, puh-lease. Like I said, it was an adolescent Alpha Vice throwing a little fit. The odds of the Host turning comatose, let alone berserk are practically zero. He's with our screening team now and will probably be discharged in a couple hours. It's not like you prevented a mass Epsilon Branch."</p>
                    <p>Danny's retching grew louder as they continued their jargon-filled bickering, and eventually urged Emory to throw their head over their shoulder with a scowl. "<em>God</em>, Danny, we get it!"</p>
                    <p>He whipped his head up and returned a scowl of his own, but he was unable to retort. A viscous, tar-like sludge dripped from his chin, causing Rami to defensively grip his clipboard to his chest. "Danny, you sure you don't want me to check you in? Gen's working late and could get you some Suppressants o-or an AV shot to&ndash;"</p>
                    <p>"I'd literally rather&mdash;" he punctuated his response with a final heave over the bin. He straightened and wiped his chin on his sleeve, the black tar sizzling into a fine mist. "I'm going home."</p>
                    <p>"A-at least grab your stipend!" Rami called out as Danny quickly sped down the sidewalk with a wobbly, unsteady gait.</p>
                    <p>He managed to make it home without another incident, but the second he opened his door, he scrambled to the bathroom and heaved a sticky clot of tar into the commode. The sludge almost looked like a beached jellyfish with the way it clung to the sides of the bowl as it hissed and pulsed from deterioration. Danny thought a bit too hard about how that was once inside his gut, and much more was likely sloshing around inside of him. Before he could wipe the image from his head, he had already thrown himself back over the toilet bowl to hurl once more. He squeezed his eyes shut in an attempt to stop the potentially never-ending cycle of barf, gross-out, barf and flushed the toilet as he spit out the tar stuck between his teeth.</p>
                    <p>He leaned against the bathtub with a sigh as he felt a wave of exhaustion wash over him. After a quick brush of his teeth, he retreated to his bedroom where his pile of blankets awaited him. From the clammy film of sweat on his forehead, he knew a restless night of sleep was inevitable, if he slept at all. After hours of torturous tossing and turning, entangling himself in his blankets, he finally managed to fall asleep. He dreamed for the first time in years.</p>
                    <blockquote>
                        <p>In the middle of a large, tiled room, there was a small, wooden chair placed directly in the center. Steel beams spanned across the tall, concrete ceiling that hung bright, fluorescent lights. The tiled walls were sanitized to an almost impossible whiteness and seemed to give off a light of their own. A crackling static from the speakers in the ceiling filled the room with an air of anticipation and impatience.</p>
