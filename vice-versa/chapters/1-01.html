        <p>It was another unremarkable evening at the corner store. The air conditioner rattled, struggling against the damp heat that seeped through the gaps in the doors, and a stale funk permeated the air. A lone customer wandered to the back of the store, while Danny Su&aacute;rez, the one employee on duty, struggled to stay awake behind the counter.</p>
        <p>Mundane, low-energy shifts like these were exactly why he took the job. Even though he was almost 30, his aching joints made him feel like he was closer to 70, and he just couldn't keep up anymore at jobs that expected him to haul boxes around or rush food to tables. Nodding off in a chair behind a counter at a job in the same building as his apartment was exactly where his body wanted him to be; that is, of course, if his bed wasn't an option.</p>
        <p>As much as he appreciated the peace, he had to admit that things were unnaturally calm for a Tuesday evening at the tail end of rush hour. Never in his adult life had he worked somewhere that had such abysmal foot traffic, and it was starting to weird him out. It hadn't always been like this, either.</p>
        <p>About four months ago started a steady decline in customers, then employees soon began following suit. Many quit without notice, while others took unpaid sick leave and never came back. Migraines and stomach troubles seemed to be the ailments of choice, but for some reason, Danny hadn't caught whatever was going around, and he quickly became the only responsive employee on the roster.</p>
        <p>He figured there was no sense in trying to unlock the secrets of <em>why</em> things were the way they were. It was a fact of life that sometimes things simply sucked, and as long as he still had a paycheck, he didn't pay it much mind. It wasn't close to being the first place he worked that had business troubles.</p>
        <p>Not to mention, every time he brought attention to it, as if on cue, a certain something would always happen, that something being a particularly rowdy and exhausting event that he would rather not speak into existence. As if he had that sort of control over his circumstances. If he did, he certainly wouldn't have been spending his single, precious life between a checkout counter and a wall of flavored vapes.</p>
        <p>He watched as the single customer aimlessly sauntered along the back aisle and fanned at his flushed face. Despite the air conditioner's best efforts, the humidity was smothering the store like a wet blanket. The customer took his time studying the drinks behind the glass doors, moving from one panel to the other. He slowed as time ticked by, eventually coming to a complete stop in the middle of the aisle, still no drinks in hand. Danny drew in a deep breath as his eyes grew heavy.</p>
        <p>He nearly jumped out of his skin as the door suddenly flew open and sent the bell above it into a clamor. "Guess who!" announced the lively character as they leapt across the threshold, landing with a loud thud. Their scruffy mane of fire-red hair settled around the bulky olive jacket as they wiggled their thick eyebrows in anticipation of his response.</p>
        <p>His shoulders fell in exasperation. "Emory," he muttered with begrudging acknowledgement. He had tried so hard not to jinx his quiet evening, too, but even if he did have that sort of control, Emory Torres went wherever they pleased. And much to his chagrin, wherever they pleased was often the corner store.</p>
        <p>"What? No reaction to me winding up here again?"</p>
        <p>He found it hard to believe they "wound up" anywhere, as if they were summoned by some mystical, otherworldly force and didn't walk there with their own two feet. But, if you asked Emory, they touted having a sixth sense when it came to Vices&mdash;the fleshy, parasitic creatures embedded in roughly 62% of the population's innards. A phenomenon known as a "Branch" was the disorienting and occasionally deadly side effect of having this sentient tumor throbbing in your viscera. Emory claimed they could sense these Branches before they began and address them accordingly.</p>
        <p>"Sure you're in the right place? Business isn't exactly booming tonight." He gestured to the single customer, still at the back of the store.</p>
        <p>"Just because <em>you're</em> not busy doesn't mean something's not getting stirred up around here. This is a big building; could be someone in the pawn shop next door, could be one of your neighbors in the apartments upstairs, could even be you." They planted their hands on their hips with a scoff, "I mean, don't you find it the teensiest bit odd I got called here again?"</p>
        <p>He returned their scoff. "You're talking like this is your job and you got called here on official duty. I'm shocked you haven't been reported yet."</p>
        <p>"For what?"</p>
        <p>"Impersonating a Target Hunter."</p>
        <p>"Oh, come on, man. Like you even give a shit."</p>
        <p>It was true that he didn't give a shit. He couldn't care less if Emory decided to pursue a reputable career or run around the city like some sort of varmint vigilante. The problem he had was being subjected to the topic of Vices every time Emory "wound up" at the corner store&mdash;talking about them always prompted a nausea spell&mdash;and asking them to keep their antics to themself was simply out of the question.</p>
        <p>"I don't know why you insist on doing this on your own," Danny began his regular, futile attempt to discourage them. "Rami's told you he could get you a job with CVRS. That station's Public Deployment is understaffed anyway, so they're probably desperate. You'd get paid much better than those wimpy civilian intervention stipends, you know."</p>
        <p>"It's not about the money." They turned their head with a snooty huff. "Plus, their incompetence is the whole reason I started doing this in the first place. CVRS is the last place I wanna work."</p>
        <p>"Either way, Rami said to cut it out. It'd be a shame if he found out you were still running around doing all this after y'all's last spat."</p>
        <p>Emory's face fell into a scowl. "What, are you gonna tell on me? What good does tattling do for you?"</p>
        <p>"It'd cut down on your impromptu visits, that's for sure."</p>
        <p>"They're not <em>impromptu</em>. I've told you a million times; there's an art to this! Regardless, this store alone has had..." they muttered to themself as they counted on their fingers, "...eight rogue Branches in the last three months&mdash;nine if this call doesn't end up being a dud&mdash;so something weird's gotta be going on here. Lucia said y'all hadn't had a Branch here in years before all this started up, so something about this area keeps triggering them."</p>
        <p>"Keep that to yourself, alright? She's already stressed about sales and not having anyone to work shifts. The last thing she needs to be worried about is some..." he wiggled his fingers vaguely as he powered through a brief wave of nausea, "...weird Vice bullshit."</p>
        <p>"It's not uncommon for things like that to be linked, you know." Emory flipped their hair behind their shoulder. "And I've already talked about it with her. She agrees with me! She thinks something's causing all this, too!"</p>
        <p>"Oh, come on. That's getting a little conspiratorial. What's your theory? That some big bad hiding in the closet is making our employees sick and bonking customers on the head with a magic Branch-inducing mallet?"</p>
        <p>"Of course not. But it's all gotta be connected, you know? I mean, what are the odds Lucia's barely able to keep the store afloat while y'all have had more Branches in three months than there have been for the store's entire operation?"</p>
        <p>"I dunno what to tell ya, man. Shit happens." Emory scoffed. "And you made fun of <em>my</em> theory."</p>
        <p>"It's not a theory, I just think things are cyclical and sometimes life just sucks. It's a lot more productive to accept that than think something's up every time things don't go your way. The universe is a cold and uncaring place. Sometimes a shitty little corner store ends up with a sharp decline in sales and eight Branches in three months. Life's just unfair like that sometimes."</p>
        <p>"You were an emo kid, weren't you? I think I remember Gen telling me that."</p>
        <p>He waved them off with a groan. "Go be a public nuisance somewhere else, alright? You're giving me a headache."</p>
        <p>"Careful!" They waggled their finger. "Lucia said that's how a lot of other employees started before they quit! If the store loses you, it'll definitely have to close."</p>
        <p>"Oh, I know what's causing this headache, don't worry." He rubbed at his temples. "It's a tension headache, specifically. From clenching my jaw. Because of you. Now..." He gestured vaguely to the empty store. "Off you go."</p>
        <p>"So much for being grateful." They planted their hands on their hips with a scowl. "I don't have to be here, you know."</p>
        <p>"I don't think you <em>should</em> be here, actually. I think what you're doing is reckless and unnecessary. And, you know what else? I actually think you're parading around as a fake Target Hunter because you have some deep-rooted issues you refuse to address."</p>
        <p>"Well, thank god no one asked what you think."</p>
        <p>They pulled a pair of fingerless gloves from their jacket pocket and donned a pair of orange-tinted aviation goggles. Both accessories were CVRS-issued articles given to agents after completing training, though these in particular had been fished out of the dumpster in the back alley. The gloves were frayed and the lenses of the goggles were cracked, but Emory cared more about their function than their aesthetics.</p>
        <p>Behind their amber lenses, the goggles revealed a previously-invisible field of fuzzy, white particles hanging in the air around them. "See? Something has to be up. There's always a lot of these, uh...these things out before a Branch."</p>
        <p>Danny knew what they were, but opted to keep it to himself. He had learned quite a bit about Vices over time, both from past CVRS visits and from the career-focused rants of his close friends, Gen and Rami. He didn't exactly want Emory to find out he knew as much as he did, lest they bombard him with requests for theory validations, at least more than they already did. He merely offered a grunt in response.</p>
        <p>"Welp, I think I might do a lap and see what all the fuss is about." They took a single step forward before they froze and whipped their head around their shoulder. "Wait, do you smell that?"</p>
        <p>He rolled his eyes. "Yeah, you're not the first person to mention it. I'll put out an air freshener t&mdash;"</p>
        <p>"No, no, not the funk. It's something new." Emory held up a quieting finger as they sniffed the air curiously. They continued in a hushed tone, "You really don't smell that?"</p>
        <p>His stomach turned as he noted their seriousness. A wave of dread urged a clammy sweat across his forehead. "Not really," he lied, now aware of the faintest whiff of sour milk.</p>
        <p>A sudden sensation tugged at the soles of his feet. He stumbled forward, catching himself on the counter with a wince as the pressure shifted and a high-pitched ring tore through his ears.</p>
        <p>Their face lit up. "Oh! Did you feel something?" The tug at the heels of their boots verified their suspicions, and they nearly elevated off the floor in excitement. "Oh, hell yeah! I <em>knew</em> I was in the right place! It's Branch time, baby!"</p>
        <p>"E-Emory, seriously? Don't make me go through this again." He looked past them to meet the eyes of the young man at the back of the store. The Host's pupils were wide and face, pallid as a single, pointed horn tore through his forehead and patches of scales erupted from the soft flesh of his arms. The Host's chest hitched erratically as a gurgling liquid in his throat masked a desperate plea.</p>
        <p>Danny swallowed dryly, unable to pull his eyes away. No matter how many times he witnessed it, he couldn't get used to it. Perhaps it wasn't something one was supposed to get used to anyway. Seeing a live human body constrained and disarmed by spores from the parasite living inside of it was enough to keep Danny awake at night, and often did. The intent behind an initiated Branch, knowing the fleshy mass was about to expand its writhing, throbbing core throughout the Host's body, if he thought too much about it, he swore he could feel it pulsing between his viscera. His face was as pale as the Host's as he weakly stammered out, "A-a-are you really sure you should be doing this?"</p>
        <p>Emory, on the other hand, reacted to this knowledge with a sort of morbid fascination rather than disgust. "Oh, I'm <em>so</em> sure. I've got this down to a minute. Time me."</p>
        <p>They drove their heel against the floor, and a bright flash of light pulsed from their bandaged knee, shooting a beam into the air above them. It expanded and morphed into a baseball bat in a burst of bright cyan. The details were soft, and its form was fluid, but it was undeniably a baseball bat, pulsing with light.</p>
        <p>Light shot from between their fingers as they tightened their hands around the grip. Emory radiated an enviable confidence, their arms stable and breaths controlled. They threw their bat over their shoulder and bolted down the aisle with unwavering conviction.</p>
        <p>Danny tried to ignore the tightening lump of disgust in his throat, but the magnetic pull of a Branch staging was one that rivaled the morbid fascination of watching a train wreck. It was practically impossible to look away, no matter how much he wanted to. The last thing he wanted to see was Emory's barbaric Branch suspension tactics in action for the umpteenth time, but he didn't have a choice. He wasn't sure what would happen if he looked away, but he didn't want to find out, so he stared ahead and gripped the countertop, afraid of being pulled in.</p>
        <p>Emory lunged toward the Host, their eyes aflame with a wild frenzy, and the pulsing barrel smashed against his cheek in a brilliant burst of light. A clear, viscous goop shot from his mouth and hissed against the linoleum as he stumbled back, clattering against the glass doors. Emory drove the top of the bat into his gut, and a wet, miserable cough heaved dribbles of goop down his chin.</p>
        <p>One more smack against his other cheek was all it took for the Host to fall to the ground in a shallow puddle of the bubbling slime that oozed from his slack lips and unresponsive eyes. The Host's body spasmed briefly, then went limp, signaling a successful suspension.</p>
        <p>Emory raised a victorious fist, pumping their bat into the air before it warped out of sight in a bright flash of sparkling light. "Danny! How long was that?"</p>
        <p>He cautiously emerged from behind the counter, the pressure in his head equalizing as the light tug against his heels faded. "I-I don't know. I wasn't timing."</p>
        <p>He covered his mouth with a gag as he approached the unconscious Host lying in a puddle of hissing goo. "Hosts in staging can't do much to fight back," he remarked, recalling the sedative haze that draped over him when the spores coursed through his body. Emory, of all people, should have been familiar with the sensation as well. "The magical bat seems a tad overkill."</p>
        <p>"Listen, I earned this patch. It's only fair that I use it for its intended purpose. Plus, it makes things quick, and I don't have to risk accidentally getting pulled in as an Adjunct."</p>
        <p>Never mind that patches most certainly were not intended to be used for suspension&mdash;they were the last resort of last resorts&mdash;but he didn't feel like arguing with them when a body was laying unconscious in a puddle of acid. The scene reeked of sour milk as the acid's pungent fumes warped the drink shelves behind them.</p>
        <p>Emory gestured toward the man with a nod. "Well? You gonna help me?"</p>
        <p>"Help you with what?"</p>
        <p>"I only suspended it. Help me get him to Urgent Care so CVRS can commit it."</p>
        <p>"I'd really rather not." He grimaced as he tightened his arms around his uneasy stomach. "You know I can't stand this stuff. I think I've had my share for tonight. Or a month."</p>
        <p>"Ah, yeah? Would you rather me leave him here and wait for it to come back?"</p>
        <p>"I just don't see why we can't call CVRS to come take care of things." Danny knew initiated Branches in quick succession were unlikely, no matter how threatening the Vice was. It just wasn't within their abilities. As much as he didn't want to keep an unconscious body on the floor, ignoring it would come much easier to him than carrying the body down the street and having to maintain his sanity inside a CVRS building.</p>
        <p>"Listen man, I don't know anything about this guy's Vice. I only suspended it, so who knows how quickly it'll come back!"</p>
        <p>Danny's jaw tightened. "You know, good point. I think it's good for you to remind yourself you don't know anything about these people's Vices. You have no idea what you're getting into with each case being different."</p>
        <p>They blew him off with a scoff. "It's not like suspension is risky. It's a perfectly viable way to address a Branch. CVRS does it all the time!"</p>
        <p>"They're suspending Branches for patients they have stupidly in-depth profiles on! They're not making those decisions in a vacuum." It was getting difficult to hide his extensive Vice knowledge. Suspension was very much frowned upon within CVRS circles and was typically only performed as a last resort in emergencies. Not to mention, suspensions had never been particularly easy for him to recover from and usually gave him lingering symptoms for weeks. Suspending one of his Branches was most certainly risky. "You don't know how these things could retaliate! Not just against you, but against the Host!"</p>
        <p>"I stopped the damn thing! What's your damage?"</p>
        <p>"I'm just thinking that if I were in his situation, would&mdash;"</p>
        <p>"Oh, of <em>course</em> you're thinking of yourself and not the unconscious guy laying in a puddle of acid."</p>
        <p>"You're the one who made him unconscious! Jesus, Emory, I really don't understand why you won't just leave this to the professionals!"</p>
        <p>They threw out their arms and gestured theatrically at the empty store around them. "See any professionals? I suspend the Branches the professionals don't know about. That's my whole thing! Better than risking my life <em>and</em> the Host's by trying to commit it instead! Is that what you want?"</p>
        <p>"You don't think beating them unconscious with a baseball bat is risky?"</p>
        <p>"Shit, man! It's better than the alternative! Would you rather someone smack you around a few times and give you a sore neck for a few days, or are you chill with a sentient alien tumor taking over your body and exploding you into a million billion pieces?" They shrugged their shoulders, awaiting his answer to their rhetorical question.</p>
        <p>"Guh&mdash;quit! Just stop. I hate thinking about that." He flailed his hands in disgust. "I'm done talking about this. Just take your suspended Host and get out of here, please!"</p>
        <p>They silently gestured to the body again, looking at him like he was stupid.</p>
        <p>He threw his hands up in exasperation. "What? What do you want from me?"</p>
        <p>"He's too tall! I can't carry him!"</p>
        <p>"What would you do if I wasn't here?"</p>
        <p>"Does that matter? You're here now!"</p>
        <p>"It <em>does</em> matter, because I don't want to do this!"</p>
        <p>Their voices overlapped as their volume grew louder. Arguing with either of them was like arguing with a brick wall. Emory was particularly difficult because they didn't hear you half the time, and Danny was as stubborn as a mule. Usually. Emory had a grating way of wearing him down, powered by a seemingly endless supply of totally unadulterated absurdity. After a while, he didn't even know what he was arguing about anymore, so he just gave in. He was stubborn, but more than anything, he was tired.</p>
        <p>"God, fine." He ran his hands down his face with a dramatic groan. "If I take him to CVRS, you owe me a beer. Or actually, I want a bowl of ramen. Or better yet, how about you promise to give me some damn space and quit coming to the corner store?"</p>
        <p>"No can do. I go where I'm called! And the corner store has me on speed dial."</p>
        <p>"God, you're a fuckin' dweeb. Buy me ramen, then. With extra eggs." He bent down and inspected the puddle of acid with a crinkled frown. "Are you sure this stuff's okay to touch?"</p>
        <p>"Hell if I know." Emory pulled a wad of napkins from the dispenser. "I suppose there's only one way to find out."</p>
        <hr class="divider">
        <p>Emory and Danny and their unconscious Host were met with a wry smile from Kieran, the Urgent Care Intake Coordinator. She was fastidious and thorough and quite familiar with Emory's antics after having been their primary point of contact for over a year. Before they approached the counter, she already had the paperwork started, having Emory's contact info and methods memorized.</p>
        <p>She peered over her computer screen and adjusted the orange-tinted bifocals on the bridge of her nose as she scanned the unresponsive body awkwardly cradled in Danny's plastic-wrapped arms. The body, too, was bundled in a plastic tarp, acid dripping from the corners and hissing against the cold tile. "Another peer-admitted Branch Revision, I presume?"</p>
        <p>Emory confidently puffed out their chest. "You know it! Suspended the Branch with my own personal patch a little over an hour ago." They continued to give their account, which was, of course, over-exaggerated and stuffed with incorrect or outdated industry jargon.</p>
        <p>Kieran nodded attentively, documenting a more realistic version of their account, then glanced up at Danny, who was struggling to get a firm hold on the Host's dripping body. She noticed multiple bandages around his fingers. "Well, I know Emory's whole routine, so what was your role in all of this?"</p>
        <p>He was in his own world, trying with all his might to ignore the smell of alcohol swabs slowly beginning to overpower the rancid milk fumes coming off the Host. It was the trademark scent of CVRS, no matter what office, no matter what station, the stinging sensation of rubbing alcohol was always there to assault patients' nostrils.</p>
        <p>"He's just helping me carry the patient." Emory waved him off, then casually leaned against the counter and cracked their knuckles. "I did all the work."</p>
        <p>"I see," Kieran smiled to herself as she wrapped up the admission paperwork. "Since we don't know his Vice's class, you've been bumped up to the top of the queue as a CYA. The Floor Manager should be out to initiate intake shortly."</p>
        <p>Danny stumbled over to the waiting room with an acknowledging grunt. He found a chair in the corner of the room and sat down with a huff, the dripping tarp flinging acid onto the wall with a sizzle.</p>
        <p>Emory nervously drummed their fingers on the counter. "Hey, so, uh...about that Floor Manager. Is Rami running the floor tonight?"</p>
        <p>"He is. And if I remember correctly, he's told you multiple times to stop playing Target Hunter. Correct?"</p>
        <p>"And?" They straightened with a forced laugh. "You really think he's capable of scolding people? Effectively, I mean. He's got the backbone of an overcooked spaghetti noodle."</p>
        <p>She chuckled to herself as the doors exuberantly flew open beside her. In walked a handsomely fat, enthusiastic man with a charmingly fluffy beard and dazzling smile. His white lab coat fluttered behind him as he strolled to the middle of the room, carrying a welcomed wave of bergamot with him. He hurriedly flipped through his clipboard, twirling a pen between his fingers as he skimmed the admission notes.</p>
        <p>"Alrighty, we're ready for a John Doe, peer-admitted by Em&mdash;wait...Emory?" He squinted at the clipboard and then straightened with a scowl. He threw his hands up in exasperation as they sheepishly hid behind their jacket. "Did we not just get done talking about this? I told you to knock it off!"</p>
        <p>They shrugged cautiously. "Well, when duty calls..."</p>
        <p>"I'll deal with you later. First things first, Kieran mentioned the patient was unconscious and wrapped in a tarp? So, where's the p&mdash;oh god, <em>Danny?</em> You dragged poor Danny into this?"</p>
        <p>Danny had almost completely slipped out of the chair, a product of staring off into space while he temporarily left his body. The bundled patient was precariously slumped over his knees, dripping acid into a puddle by his feet.</p>
        <p>Emory snapped at him. "Ayo, Danny! That's your cue!"</p>
        <p>He bolted upright with a startled sniff, then awkwardly gathered the patient as he scrambled to his feet. "Oh, thank god. I think the acid was starting to eat through the tarp."</p>
        <p>"Right, right. Come on back!" Rami opened the doors and ushered them to follow. "We're packed tonight, but I've got all my Traffic Coordinators helping out. I can take care of y'all really quick."</p>
        <p>Emory gave Danny a couple convincing shoves, and he stumbled forward reluctantly.</p>
        <p>Rami could see his hesitation, evident by his scrunched eyebrows and pained grimace. He tried to reassure him. "It'll be quick! Just set him down right here," he patted the hospital bed and began flipping on various machines. "I'll just need you to fill out a report, and&mdash;"</p>
        <p>"O-oh, no. No need to do that." The familiar beeps of medical monitors, the metallic clicking of old hospital beds, and the hurried voices of agents took him to a place he didn't want to be. It was hard for him to think. A light flutter in his chest urged beads of sweat on his brow. "I just carried the body. Emory handled it. They can fill out the report," his voice cracked.</p>
        <p>Rami shot Emory a nasty look, who was hiding behind Danny's absurdly tall frame, then he looked up at him with an apologetic smile. "Well, it's still protocol to gather reports from any available witnesses. It'll only take a few minutes since it was a suspension."</p>
        <p>"No thanks. I've done my good deed for the day." Danny awkwardly shed the patient from his arms and he rolled onto the bed with a lifeless thud.</p>
        <p>Rami adjusted the small, round glasses perched atop his strong nose. They were tinted amber, much like Emory's goggles and Kieran's bifocals. He wrinkled his nose as he took a deep inhale. "Yep, that's a suspension if I've ever seen one."</p>
        <p>Dense, glowing white splatters painted the patient's body, primarily smeared across his face where the acid continued to trickle out. His face was gradually returning color, with a couple red welts where Emory's fantastical bat had made contact with his skin. It was a wonder those were all the injuries he left with, and not a broken neck.</p>
        <p>Without the pungent fumes of acid dominating Danny's nostrils, the smell of rubbing alcohol was overpowering. His stomach began to churn with a familiar uneasiness, his gut heavy with dread. "Yeah, I can't do this, Rami. I need to get outta here."</p>
        <p>Rami relented with a polite sigh as he began hooking the patient up to various beeping machines and wiping him down with a cloth. "Fair enough. But you missed work for this, right? I'll fill it out for you so you at least get a stipend, and I'll just have you sign it. Feel free to stay in the waiting room, or you can even wait outside if that would make you feel better. It'll only be a minute."</p>
        <p>"Why's he getting a stipend? I did all the work!" Emory cried.</p>
        <p>"I thought you said you weren't doing this for the stipends!" Rami's professional facade fell now that they were behind closed doors, and he let out an immature groan of exasperation. "Ugh, <em>whatever!</em> I don't care <em>why</em> you're doing it, but you promised me you'd stop! This is getting out of hand!"</p>
        <p>Their budding argument faded as Danny made a bee-line for the exit. As entertaining as it would've been to watch Emory get chewed out, he knew it wouldn't be anything he hadn't heard before. He gave Kieran an obligatory nod as he blew through the waiting room, then stepped outside and took a deep breath.</p>
        <p>His shoulders slumped with a loud exhale as he melted down in a dramatic flourish to take a seat on the curb. His nausea was catching up with him, and as much as he would've preferred to head home, he was afraid any more steps would have urged a very convincing gag.</p>
        <p>The stinging scent of rubbing alcohol still lingered in his nostrils, and he dragged his hands down his face with a miserable groan. Just the slightest whiff was able to launch his nervous system into survival mode. He inhaled deeply, hoping the breaths of admittedly rank city air were enough to fend off the oncoming nausea spell.</p>
        <p>There wasn't much that could help anymore, short of spending hours swaddled under a pile of 3 blankets, at a minimum. He had gotten particularly skilled at warding off these episodes, but only if he had the luxury of being nestled under his covers. And as it turned out, he wasn't in bed, and even though the humid summer air was smothering him like a wet blanket, he could no longer delay the inevitable.</p>
        <p>Rami hopped out from the revolving door, waving a slip of paper. "Danny! I've got your&mdash; oh...oh no." His shoulders withered with pity as he watched Danny brace himself over the trashcan and heave his stomach contents into the bin. "Do I need to check you in?"</p>
        <p>Danny offered a dismissive wave before continuing his retching.</p>
        <p>"Well, once you're done I've got your stipend."</p>
        <p>Emory squeezed their way out the door with a huff. "I still don't think it's fair his is the same as mine."</p>
        <p>"It's not like the stipends are that much to begin with. You're gonna look at this pathetic wet-paper-towel-of-a-man and deny him even just a little compensation for helping out tonight? Poor guy could've just gone home and watched his cooking shows, and now he's barfing in a public trash can because you looped him into your shenanigans again."</p>
        <p>"I didn't loop him into anything! The Branch just so happened to have been at the store again! And if I hadn't done anything, he and the Host would've been dead!"</p>
        <p>"Oh, puh-lease." Rami rolled his eyes. "It was an adolescent Alpha Vice throwing a little fit. The odds of the Host turning comatose, let alone berserk, were practically zero. He'll be discharged in a couple hours after an undoubtedly successful Branch commit. It's not like you prevented a mass Theta dispersion."</p>
        <p>Danny whipped his head up, fully intending to tell them to shut up, but all he could manage was a scowl. A viscous, tar-like sludge dripped from his chin, causing Rami to defensively grip his clipboard to his chest.</p>
        <p>"Danny, you sure you don't want me to check you in? Gen's working late and could get you some Suppressants o-or maybe even an AV Shot to&ndash;"</p>
        <p>"I'd literally rather&mdash;" he punctuated his response with a final heave over the bin. He straightened and wiped his chin on his sleeve, the black tar sizzling into a fine mist. "I'm going home."</p>
        <p>"A-at least grab your stipend!" Rami called out as Danny quickly sped down the sidewalk.</p>
        <p>"Give it to Emory, since they wanted it so bad!" He yelled back, throwing his hand in the air with a dismissive flourish that seemed to be enough movement to trigger another wave of nausea.</p>
        <p>He leaned over and hacked a wad of sludge into a nearby flower bed, then continued his quick walk home. He managed to make it without further incident, but the second he opened his door, a clammy wave of nausea overtook him and propelled him to the bathroom.</p>
        <p>He fell to his knees as a ball of muck worked its way up his throat. Pain shot up to his hips as the tile floor ate into his kneecaps. The contortion of his spine threw his upper back into a spasm as he heaved the sticky clot of tar into the commode.</p>
        <p>The squishy lump almost looked like a beached jellyfish with the way it clung to the sides of the bowl as it hissed and pulsed from deterioration. He made the connection that it was once inside him, and many more like it were likely sloshing around inside of him.</p>
        <p>A convincing gag urged another up his throat, and his neck ached with fatigue. He squeezed his eyes shut as another glob tumbled out of his mouth, clinging to his tongue, the back of his teeth, his lips. It splattered against the surface tension of the water and deteriorated with a high-pitched whine. He quickly closed the lid and gave it another flush, draping himself across the lid with an exhausted groan.</p>
        <p>He sucked at the tar stuck between his teeth and quickly spit it into the trash before he could process its slimy texture. He lamented the cruelty of his blights, how easy it was to get stuck in a torturous loop, and tears brimmed as he savored the brief reprieve from nausea.</p>
        <p>Getting into bed seemed to be an insurmountable task, but the idea of sleeping on the bathroom floor made his joints preemptively ache even more than they were. Standing up was a monumental achievement, punctuated with various cracking joints as he rose to his feet.</p>
        <p>His pile of blankets welcomed him into bed and he sank into the mattress, his bones clicking as they all settled into place. From the clammy film of sweat on his forehead and the tension headache forming at the base of his neck, he knew a restless night of sleep was inevitable, if he slept at all.</p>
        <p>After hours of torturous tossing and turning, entangling himself in his blankets, he finally managed to fall asleep, and he dreamed for the first time in years.</p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>In the middle of a large, tiled room, there was a small, wooden chair placed in the perfect center. Bright, fluorescent lights punctuated the steel beams that spanned across the high concrete ceiling. The tiled walls were sanitized to an almost impossible whiteness and seemed to give off a light of their own. A crackling static from the speakers overhead filled the room with an air of anticipation and impatience.</p>
