                <h2>Sectors</h2>
                <p>CVRS is divided into two sectors: Public Health & Safety and Research. Each sector has unique goals, but often collaborates with the other to aggregate or share data. Public Health & Safety is primarily public-facing and provides hands-on care, while Research primarily aggregates and studies data submitted by Public Health & Safety, with limited interaction with Hosts.</p>
                <h3 id="phs">Public Health &amp; Safety</h3>
                <p>The Public Health and Safety sector is broad in its skillset, though it focuses mostly on administering medical care, treatment, and support to Hosts as well as mitigating immediate threats. Within Public Health & Safety, agents with the same title can belong to different teams that with different roles. These teams consist of Primary Care, Urgent Care, and Public Deployment. The PHS Sector Advocate oversees the three teams, determines local strategies, and advocates on their behalf to the executive wing. Each team designates a lead agent to represent the team and communicate with the PHS Sector Advocate on the team’s behalf in addition to their regular duties.</p>
                <h4 id="primary-care">Primary Care</h4>
                <p>Agents in Primary Care provide long-term treatment for active Hosts who have been admitted by a Record Admin. Vice Management Specialists are the heart of Primary Care and drive treatment plans and execution. Primary Care can consist of:</p>
                <ul class="two-col">
                    <li>Vice Management Specialist</li>
                    <li>Vice Management Coordinator</li>
                    <li>Branch Administrator</li>
                    <li>Branch Coordinator</li>
                    <li>Solutions Architect</li>
                    <li>Intake Coordinator</li>
                    <li>Record Administrator</li>
                    <li>Blight Specialist</li>
                    <li>Branch Recovery Specialist</li>
                    <li>Branch Proctor</li>
                </ul>
                <h4 id="urgent-care">Urgent Care</h4>
                <p>Agents in Urgent Care provide acute care and treat at-risk Hosts from both Primary Care and Public Deployment, as well as public admissions. Urgent Care is trained to commit threatening Branches and refer Hosts back to Primary Care to resume or begin treatment. Many patients who have had recently suspended Branches self-admit. Urgent Care can consist of:</p>
                <ul class="two-col">
                    <li>Intake Coordinator</li>
                    <li>Floor Manager</li>
                    <li>Traffic Coordinator</li>
                    <li>Branch Administrator</li>
                    <li>Branch Coordinator</li>
                    <li>Solutions Architect</li>
                    <li>Branch Recovery Specialist</li>
                </ul>
                <h4 id="public-deployment">Public Deployment</h4>
                <p>Agents in Public Deployment are on-call 24/7, often patrolling high-traffic hot spots, led by their resident Target Hunter. These agents respond to public and rogue Branches or can be requested to address a potential threat by calling our emergency hotline. This team also serves as a clean-up crew post-Branch and ensures no anomalies have occurred. Most CVRS stations have multiple Public Deployment teams in rotation. A single Public Deployment team can consist of:</p>
                <ul class="two-col">
                    <li>Target Hunter</li>
                    <li>Branch Administrator</li>
                    <li>Branch Coordinator</li>
                    <li>Solutions Architect</li>
                    <li>Branch Recovery Specialist</li>
                </ul>
                <h3 id="research">Research</h3>
                <p>The Research Sector is comprised of analysts and researchers working to expand our knowledge and understanding of Vices. Research is split into two teams with different roles, Aggregation and Observation. The Research Sector Advocate oversees the two teams, determines local priorities, and advocates on their behalf to the executive wing. The Lead Station Aggregator represents the Aggregation team while the Research Proctor represents the Observation team; these two agents communicate with the Research Sector Advocate on the teams’ behalf in addition to their regular duties.</p>
                <h4 id="aggregation">Aggregation</h4>
                <p>The Aggregation team primarily curates, sorts, and prioritizes information submitted by the Observation team and agents from Public Health & Safety. Report Coordinators and Forecast Specialists organize the local database of information for review by the Lead Station Aggregator, who can submit local anomalies and novel observations to be reviewed and considered by the Research Sector Advocate as additions to the master database managed by the executive wing. Aggregation consists of:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Report Coordinator</li>
                    <li>Forecast Specialist</li>
                    <li>Lead Station Aggregator</li>
                </ul>
                <h4 id="observation">Observation</h4>
                <p>A unique team of Pseudo Adjuncts who accompany both the Primary Care and Urgent Care teams in Branches of all types, from standard to rogue to instigated. These agents only communicate with Report Coordinators in Aggregation and do not interfere with or have an impact on active Branches. These agents often sit in on appointments with Vice Management Specialists to observe their respective areas firsthand. Their observations are strictly for aggregation purposes and are not shared directly with Primary Care or Urgent Care agents—as they are with Solutions Architects. Rather their observations and conclusions are compiled by a team of Report Coordinators and considered for addition to the local CVRS database by the Lead Station Aggregator. Observation consists of:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Research Proctor</li>
                    <li>Vice Analyst</li>
                    <li>Branch Analyst</li>
                    <li>Behavioral Analyst</li>
                </ul>

                <p>The structure of CVRS stations and teams are less focused on hierarchy and more interested in fostering an environment of collaboration, where agents no matter their title are empowered to lead and contribute in their respective areas. The roles covered in this compendium are station agents facilitating local research and support, as well as sector advocates. Information pertaining to executive wing roles is available upon request.</p>

                    <span class="label">PHS01-123</span>
                </div>
                <p>Branch Administrators are highly skilled, experienced agents enlisted by Vice Management Specialists, Target Hunters and Floor Managers to address Branches for aggressive or threatening Vices. They are specially trained to commit, but will rescind if possible and suspend if necessary for public safety. Branch Administrators are the agents most familiar with rescission, and while each agent has their own unique approach, they often lean on their powerful and versatile patch to do so. As part of Public Deployment, Branch Administrators also record data and help clean up Branch sites.</p>

                </div>
                <p>Trained to commit Branches, these agents typically accompany Branch Administrators and serve as support for more complex Branches or fill in for Branch Administrators when teams are short-staffed. They have less experience than Branch Administrators, but are still an invaluable addition to any team due to their breadth of knowledge and wide range of skills. Branch Coordinators can also support Floor Managers and Vice Management Specialists. While only trained to commit, they still often support Branch Administrators performing rescission.</p>

                <p>An agent concerned exclusively with post-Branch events, Branch Recovery Specialists are the primary cleaners of Branch sites and inspect the Host to ensure the Branch was properly addressed. These agents work closely alongside Vice Management Specialists, Floor Managers, and Branch Administrators to inform and approve referrals between CVRS teams, most commonly concerned with transfers between Urgent Care and Primary Care. Branch Recovery Specialists in Public Deployment often handle public relations and give reports to law enforcement and media.</p>

                <p>Record Administrators are analytical agents who determine if and how patients should be admitted for care based on the details provided by the Intake Coordinator, Floor Manager, or Branch Administrator. If the patient is new to the system, the Record Administrator will administer a VGDS, assemble a treatment plan with the recommended care team based on the proposed starting classification, then hand the Host off to a Vice Management Specialist to begin long-term treatment. If an existing patient is referred from Urgent Care of Public Deployment, the Record Administrator will reassess the Host’s status and record any anomalies before passing them back to their Vice Management Specialist.</p>

Like Aggregation agents, Branch Proctors never come in direct contact with Hosts, though they do remotely monitor vitals and communicate with Adjuncts from the observation deck. Branch Proctors are the ones to officially instigate Branches and collect Branch-relevant observations and submissions logged with the Adjuncts’ MobiComms.

                <h2 id="training">Branch Training</h2>
                <p>All CVRS agents are required to complete and pass their respective training course prior to their start date. The level of training coincides with the agent's role and is determined based on their proximity to and projected impact on Hosts. Each level of training builds on the ones before it; for example, the information covered in Basic Training is included in Suspension Training.</p>
                <h3>Basic</h3>
                <p>Basic Training gives a high-level overview of Vice anatomy, physiology, and psychology, ensuring agents have a firm foundation in Vice fundamentals. During this time, agents learn about the properties of Branches and common Branch formulae. Agents expected to be brought in as pseudo Adjuncts (Solutions Architect, Behavioral Analyst, Branch Analyst, and Vice Analyst) must pass a written exam.</p>
                <h3>Suspension</h3>
                <p>Because these agents are expected to make regular direct contact with Hosts, suspension training entails the regular observation of initiated Branches by bringing in agents as pseudo Adjuncts. In this training, agents learn to prioritize speed and efficiency, practice decision-making under pressure, and learn to recognize the warning signs of Branches. The agent must successfully suspend a Branch as a secondary Adjunct in order to receive certification, in addition to passing a written exam.</p>
                <h3>Commitment</h3>
                <p>Rather than training agents as pseudo Adjuncts, agents are regularly brought in as secondary Adjuncts in active Branches. During this training, agents focus on honing and properly wielding their patches to aid in successful commits while building the discernment and observations skills already covered in suspension training. Commitment Training is considerably more rigorous compared to Suspension Training, as agents are expected to familiarize themselves with both the local and master research databases. Agents must successfully commit a Branch as a secondary Adjunct in order to receive certification, in addition to passing written, oral, and psychological exams.</p>
                <h3>Rescission</h3>
                <p>Rescission training is the most rigorous Branch training and requires agents to routinely commit Branches by shadowing current agents. Many agents with this degree of experience do not suspend Branches unless a commit would threaten the safety of the Host or Adjuncts. An agent must successfully rescind a Vice as a secondary Adjunct and pass written, oral, and psychological exams in order to become certified. If an agent is unable to rescind a Vice in the time allotted, they are enrolled in a new round of training and start from the ground up.</p>
                <h2 id="equipment">Equipment</h2>
                <p>Upon completion of training, agents are provided an equipment bundle to aid in their duties, further explored below. In addition to the issued equipment bundles, agents are required to visibly display their ID badges at all times while on duty. Agents can choose between displaying their ID with a lanyard, badge reel, or lapel clip. Bags are available upon request to help transport equipment bundles between sites. Agents may choose from a tote bag, small duffel bag, or backpack. Agents with 10 or more years of collective service are presented with a custom embroidered satchel.</p>

                </figure>
                <h3>DigiData (Digital Database)</h3>
                <p>This information-packed tablet contains both the local and master research databases and is automatically updated to reflect the most recent findings. The databases are searchable and support bookmarking and personal annotations. All agents are issued a DigiData at the start of their respective training courses.</p>
                <h3>MobiComm (Mobile Communications)</h3>
                <p>Similar in appearance and function to a pager, this communication tool allows agents to communicate with each other, request backup, and log findings, even within the Branch Arena. A unique shorthand communication style is used to send messages with a MobiComm, and an agent must pass a written exam in order to be issued this device and regularly pass recurring exams to stay up to date with the expanding vocabulary. Many agents use their MobiComm to log time-sensitive, case-relevant observations that can be submitted for database review by a team of Report Coordinators.</p>
                <h3 id="backdoor">Backdoor</h3>
                <p>This single-use device allows an agent to force their way into an active Branch as an Adjunct, with a success rate of about 72%. Backdoors are similar in appearance and function to tasers and attract and rekindle any stray tracks in the Host’s network to provide a path to enter the initiated Branch, bypassing the queuing process. These devices are often used in conjunction with Parsing Goggles to help scope out potential tracks. After certification, agents are provided a set of six and advised to use sparingly. Request for new kits are subject to denial if the supervisor suspects abuse. Learn more about this process in Forcing Entry.</p>
                <h3>AVCharge</h3>
                <p>These AV-packed, flashbang-adjacent explosives are used for large-scale Branch cleanup after particularly gruesome suspensions. They quickly neutralize large concentrations of VG and perform most efficiently in a closed space, such as a small building or room. Only AV are discharged, and the explosion, while extremely bright and loud, does not harm the environment or those present, outside of temporary blinding and hearing loss. AVCharges should only be used in an open space after the area has been cleared of civilians. After certification, agents are provided a bundle of six and more can be distributed upon request.</p>
                <h3 id="vgmeter">VGMeter</h3>
                <p>This handheld device has two small probes at the end that detect the levels of VG in the air. VG concentration is presented on a scale of 0 to 10, with 10 being so solid that they’re visible, opaque, and tangible. The standard reading for indoors is roughly 3.5, while outside tends to hover around 1.3; cause for concern begins around roughly 6/7 when the concentration becomes visible. VGMeters are typically used in conjunction with Parsing Goggles, which initially visualize the VG, while the VGMeter identifies concentration and severity.</p>

                </figure>
                <h3 id="boots">Cleansing Boots</h3>
                <p>Similar to Summoning Gloves, these steel-toed work boots have soles lined with AV. They are used primarily for Branch cleanup, but can also be deployed as a last-resort means of defense within the Branch Arena. The AV-charged soles make for speedy, efficient, and sanitary Branch cleanup, neutralizing and destroying sites littered with VG. Cleansing boots are activated by tapping the steel toe against the ground, and can be deactivated by doing the same. Cleansing Boots should be replaced every two years or as the tread wears down.</p>
                <h3 id="gloves">Summoning Gloves</h3>
                <p>These gloves allow for expedited patch summoning and aid in Branch cleanup thanks to their charged, AV-infused palms. Styles typically resemble sleek motorcycle gloves with a thick, textured lining on the palm, but they can vary to accommodate different patches and agent roles. These gloves also improve an agent’s grip on a summoned patch and can bolster a patch’s makeup outside of a Branch where structural instabilities are common. Summoning Gloves should be brought back for recharging after repeated use.</p>
                <p>Much like Parsing Goggles, Summoning Gloves come in different styles to accommodate agents’ needs. Such styles include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>fingerless gloves; used primarily by Branch-focused agents, as their slim design does not impede movement</li>
                    <li>surgical gloves; used primarily by Primary Care and Urgent Care agents who may need full dexterity when handling Hosts; comes in both reusable and disposable styles</li>
                    <li>work gloves; used primarily by Branch Recovery Specialists, as their bulky design helps increase AV output to aid in quick cleanup</li>
                </ul>
                <h3 id="goggles">Parsing Goggles</h3>
                <p>Goggles with polarized, treated glass that allow agents to observe VG. While this eyewear has branched out into multiple styles over the years, they are always recognizable by their trademark orange tint. This eyewear can be used to observe a Host’s network and monitor VG density in the environment. Parsing Goggles are often used in conjunction with a Backdoor to aid in locating stray tracks available for use. Please note that some Vices have unique characteristics that help their networks avoid detection, where a VGMeter may need to be used to monitor VG levels.</p>
                <p>Parsing Goggles come in an array of styles to accommodate an agent’s role. The following styles are available as options for agents to choose from upon completion of the appropriate training:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>standard eyewear; prescription lenses and bifocals can be enhanced to include the coating found in CVRS-issued eyewear; used especially by Primary Care and Observation agents</li>
                    <li>sunglasses; used especially by Public Deployment</li>
                    <li>safety glasses; ranging from standard eyewear with side-shields to single-lens wrap-arounds; used primarily by Branch-focused agents</li>
                    <li>goggles; styles include both cup and cover goggles, many models drawing inspiration from lab equipment; used primarily by Branch-focused agents</li>
                </ul>
                <h2 id="care">Establishing Care with a CVRS Team</h2>
                <p>Patients are able to begin treatment through one of two ways: by referral from a medical professional or through self-admission. After a patient is added to our system, we recommend regular appointments to keep your records up to date and relevant. If you go longer than a year without seeing a Vice Management Specialist, the screening process will need to be performed by an Intake Manager again.</p>
                <h3>Referrals (recommended)</h3>
                <p>Many Vices are first discovered by a medical professional through classic imaging techniques. Medical professionals are often trained to recognize the warning signs of a Vice and may order imaging to rule it out.</p>
                <p>Referral by a medical professional typically expedites the admission process and preliminary screenings can be administered to determine the best course of action before a patient is even seen for their first appointment. The addition of medical records can help Vice Management Specialists form a more comprehensive view of their patient as well. Historically speaking, admission through referrals is more likely to be approved compared to self-admission.</p>
                <h3>Self-Admission</h3>
                <p>If one suspects they are infected with a Vice, they are welcome to visit their local CVRS station to begin preliminary screenings. Contact Primary Care if you have chronic symptoms not explained by a doctor or have experienced a Branch that has since been committed. If your Branch was recently suspended and poses a high chance of re-initiation, we recommend admission through Urgent Care. For both teams, the verified experience of a Branch can help expedite the admission process. If you suspect a Vice due to chronic symptoms, admission may take longer and more thorough screenings may be performed in order to begin treatment.</p>
                <h3>Screening</h3>
                <p>Screening is required to complete admission and is typically comprised of a physical review as well as an oral questionnaire. If you are a self-admit through Primary Care, you will receive a preliminary questionnaire from an Intake Coordinator to fill out. If the Intake Coordinator accepts your account, you will be referred to the Intake Manager for more thorough screening, as well as a VGDS (Vitiumglomerorum Detection Screening). After you receive a positive VGDS, you will be added to the CVRS system and an appointment with a Vice Management Specialist will be scheduled.</p>
                <p>If you are self-admitting through Urgent Care, an Intake Coordinator will screen your symptoms and admit you to be seen by the Floor Manager and Traffic Coordinator on staff if you are having urgent symptoms. If your symptoms are less urgent, the Intake Coordinator will refer you to Primary Care.</p>
                <h3>Treatment Plans</h3>
                <p>As outlined in <a href="./branch.html#rescission">The Branch Phenomenon</a>, there are multiple approaches to rescission that our care team can perform, spearheaded by a Vice Management Specialist. Among the approaches are standard rescission, exposure rescission, and manual rescission. Many agents will utilize a holistic approach that draws aspects from all three, in addition to lifestyle changes. Additional treatment and support options are available, further outlined in <a href="./bodies.html#support">Treatments and Support</a>.</p>
                <h2 id="faq">Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)</h2>
                <details class="mt-sm">
                    <summary>How do I know if CVRS takes my insurance or is in network?</summary>
                    CVRS accepts most major insurance provides, but is not necessarily always in network. Check with your insurance provider prior to treatment to see if your desired CVRS station is in network. You can also call your local CVRS station to verify network coverage before treatment. Some insurance providers have location-restricted coverage, and only cover CVRS stations within a specified radius.
                </details>
                <details>
                    <summary>I had to transfer from another CVRS station. Will my insurance coverage change?</summary>
                    Not necessarily, though it is possible. Some insurance providers have location-restricted coverage, and only cover CVRS stations within a specified radius. If treatment is given outside of that radius, your coverage will not transfer. You will be notified of any changes in coverage during the transfer process.
                </details>
                <details>
                    <summary>Can I admit myself to CVRS?</summary>
                    Yes, you can self-admit through either Primary Care or Urgent Care, depending on urgency. Admission through Urgent Care should be reserved for immediate threats, such as a recent suspension or unmanageable blights. Admission through Primary Care is best suited for patients seeking long-term care.
                </details>
                <details>
                    <summary>Can I admit somebody else to CVRS?</summary>
                    In the event of lost consciousness or an unreliable psychological state, admission may be performed by a peer or CVRS agent. Admissions of this nature should be handled through Urgent Care. If you are not near a CVRS station, call your local Public Deployment team for assistance.
                </details>
                <details>
                    <summary>What do I do if I’m still having symptoms after I’ve been cleared?</summary>
                    Your Vice Management Specialist may refer you to a Blight Specialist to be evaluated. Suppressants and AVShots are available for persistent pseudo-blights, though they will ease over time. Continued observation is encouraged, as excessively persistent pseudo-blights may be indicative of an underlying issue.
                </details>
                <details>
                    <summary>Is it normal to feel sluggish or depressed while taking Suppressants?</summary>
                    Some fatigue is normal, but drastic changes in mood or energy levels should be reported to your Vice Management Specialist or Blight Specialist so your dosage can be adjusted and your symptoms monitored.
