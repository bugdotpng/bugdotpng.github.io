                <p>An unaddressed Branch can be lethal, as this allows the Vice to fully spread throughout the Host’s body and perform dispersion. A Host is likely to experience anywhere from 10 to 30 Branches in a single Vice’s life cycle. Branch properties vary widely between Hosts, but most agree that they resemble a hallucination, dream, or bout of deja-vu; though, despite this dreamlike state, Branches can have very real consequences. This trance-like effect is the result of the body being overwhelmed by microscopic spore-like cells called vitiumglomerorum, or VG for short. Learn more about VG and their biological purposes in <a href="./bio.html#reproduction">Vice Reproduction</a>.</p>
                <p>Vices feed on the hormones present in our bodies, most commonly indulging in those released during high-stress situations such as cortisol, adrenaline, and norepinephrine. They often wait for particularly triggering situations where these hormone levels are elevated. Once the Vice detects the sharp increase in hormones, it releases VG from its core to temporarily immobilize the Host’s immune system, so it can begin feeding and advancing along its established network undeterred.</p>
                <p>Branches are comprised of three phases: initiation, staging, and production. Each phase has different properties and is comprised of unique information that should be meticulously observed and documented, if possible, as learning these properties can help prepare Hosts for future Branches. Collectively, these properties are referred to as the Vice’s Branch Ops.</p>
                <h2 id="phases">Branch Phases</h2>
                <p>Branches are comprised of multiple phases, each having unique properties that can serve the Host and Adjuncts valuable information. In total, a Branch in its entirety can last anywhere from 3 to 10 minutes. Every Branch, regardless of Vice classification, follows the stages below, though some recognizable characteristics of each stage can change between classifications or not be present at all. The characteristics explored below are most commonly observed in Alpha and Beta Vices.</p>
                <div class="timeline">
                  <div class="timeline__stop">
                      <span class="superhead">Phase 1</span>
                      <h3>Initiation</h3>
                      <p>As the inciting incident of a Branch, this phase typically only lasts anywhere from roughly 5 seconds to a minute. Vices with sudden advents typically have quicker initiation periods and simpler inciting incidents—such as a single phrase or smell—while those of Vices with gradual advents tend to be longer and more complex. Knowing the properties present in a Branch initiation can help Hosts prepare for or even avoid future Branches. </p>
                      <p>Branch initiation cannot be sensed by onlookers, though after a handful of experiences, many Hosts are able to recognize their own Branch initiation, typically felt as a fluttering heartbeat or a sudden or inexplicable headache. Other side effects have been reported, such as goosebumbs, twitching muscles, nausea, dizziness, and lockjaw. Not all Hosts are able to sense Branch initiation, as is often the case when they have Vices with higher threat levels.</p>
                  </div>
                  <div class="timeline__stop">
                    <span class="superhead">Phase 2</span>
                    <h3>Staging</h3>
                    <p>During Staging, the Vice begins flooding the Host’s body with VG while the environment for the Branch is fabricated. This phase typically lasts anywhere from 1-3 minutes, depending on the intended complexity of the Branch and the reaction speed of the Host’s immune system, with instigated Branches often having shorter staging times. Because of the advancing Vice and the influx of VG throughout the body, a Host is typically hit with an initial immune response, reactions ranging from mildly irritating to excruciating. Itching, increased body temperature, sweating, and even depression, mania and anaphylaxis are all potential reactions to staging, in addition to inflamed blights. About half of Hosts are lethargic and depressed during this stage, while the other half are agitated and neurotic. As the Vice drastically increases its VG output, it overwhelms and temporarily disables the Host’s immune system to prevent further intervention.</p>
                    <p>During this phase, Adjuncts are able to be pulled in and added to the queue, a liminal space where Adjuncts linger while the Branch is being fabricated. A potential Adjunct must make and maintain physical contact with the Host throughout staging in order to be included in production. If physical contact is lost during this phase, the Adjunct will be ejected, but can easily be brought back in as long as the Branch is still in staging. As the Branch approaches production, some particularly intelligent Vices will briefly send bursts of energy not unlike hypnic jerks to potentially break contact, though this is quite the draining endeavor and is often only performed by desperate or mature Vices.</p>
                    <p>Tertiary Adjuncts are obtained through extending its network to reach any stationery people nearby. These tracks are often extremely concentrated and occur at the expense of the Vice losing a potential germination route. This behavior is often observed in mature Vices with a highly established network that are aiming for increased energy consumption during dispersion, such as Theta Vices. This connection can be easily lost, however, if the tertiary Adjunct is able to break free from the trance, which is considerably simpler due to the lack of physical contact.</p>
                    <p>A patch can be summoned to aid in suspending a Branch at any time during staging, where the patch is more abstract in its form, with fuzzy edges and warping shapes. This is due to the patch's composition of antivitiumglomerorum, or AV for short. AV are the result of our bodies' immune response, specially crafted to combat VG, and are further explored in <a href="./bodies.html">Vices and Our Bodies</a>. Suspending a Branch is not recommended for reasons further explored in <a href="#options">Branch Options</a> below.</p>
                    <p>Staging is known for its trademark "magnetic pull", typically felt in the soles of bystanders' feet, all the way up to their knees. This sensation is felt by anyone within a roughly 12-foot radius. Those within the radius report disorienting vestibular disturbances, with symptoms such as tinnitus, nausea, imbalance, and vertigo. This pull is present regardless of a Vice's intention to draw in tertiary Adjuncts and is generally considered to be the result of changes in air pressure and magnetic fields as the Host is overrun with VG.</p>

                  <div class="timeline__stop">
                    <span class="superhead">Phase 3</span>
                    <h3>Production</h3>
                    <p>Production is the most complex of the phases, and where the majority of the action takes place. This phase is split into two realms: corporeal and metaphysical. The metaphysical realm refers to the events that take place in the Branch Arena, a shared “battleground” of sorts where facsimiles of the Host and Adjuncts—called “extensions”—duel against the Vice’s exhibition, a grotesque visage that surrounds and protects the Vice’s core. Production officially begins once the Host is admitted to the Branch Arena. The corporeal realm refers to the physical state of affairs outside of the Branch Arena, including the physiological effects on the Host’s body as well as any physical interactions between the Host and Adjuncts.</p>
                    <p>The metaphysical realm operates on a different timeline from the corporeal realm, where five minutes of corporeal time can span anywhere from 10 minutes to an hour of metaphysical time. While these realms are separate, what happens in the metaphysical realm often loosely mirrors the events of the corporeal realm, and vice versa, each being able to influence the other realm. This relationship is not a direct one-to-one, and researchers are still trying to fully understand the degree to which the events that take place in each realm directly impact the other. It is generally understood how the events of the corporeal realm effect the metaphysical realm, but the opposite still requires extensive research. The metaphysical realm, and by extension the Branch Arena, is particularly difficult to observe and document from a strictly objective standpoint due to its abstract, ever-changing nature.</p>
                    <p>Branches are intended to be committed or rescinded during this phase, which can be executed in either realm, though most corporeal approaches to commits and rescissions are considered experimental. Inaction while a Branch is in production can lead to a berserk or comatose Host, which often makes committing or rescinding the Branch more difficult. This phase does not last for a determined amount of time, but if ignored, a Vice can achieve dispersion in less than 10 minutes of corporeal time, sometimes as quickly as five.</p>
                    <h4>The Corporeal Realm</h4>
                    <p>Physically, Hosts have described this realm as almost dreamlike in quality. The overwhelming rush of VG has a sedative effect on the Host to deter interference with the core’s expansion. The Host is also “disconnected” from their body in the sense that they do not react to outside stimuli, such as words or touch. The only way to break a Host from this trance is to commit or rescind the Vice. Because the Host has essentially been sedated and the immune system has been suppressed, symptoms are generally mild, only seen in small tremors and clammy skin.</p>
                    <h4>The Metaphysical Realm and Branch Arena</h4>
                    <p>Production officially begins once the Host is admitted to the Branch Arena, where the majority of action takes place. This arena is often constructed using a Host's memories and emotions—and in more extreme cases, able to include the memories of primary Adjuncts. It is finite in its boundaries, meaning the edge can be reached, though doing so poses no benefits. The five senses are able to be activated within this arena, and many are able to recall sounds, smells, and even tastes after a Branch has passed. This environment typically does not change throughout a Vice’s life cycle, but it may increase in complexity and expand to include a larger area or a different room, for example. Some intelligent Vices are capable of completely changing this environment between Branches, but this is incredibly rare.</p>
                    <p>Another facet of a Vice’s Branch formula is its exhibition, a visage only seen and deployed in the Branch Arena. Its purpose is to both intimidate the Host and protect its core, which the visage is constructed around.</p>
                    <p>In the Branch Arena, exhibitions can be as small as a house cat or span as much as 5 times taller than the average human. A Vice’s exhibition tends to remain largely unchanged throughout its life cycle, though a select few have been observed to alter their characteristics between Branches. Some suspect that core placement in the body can mimic core placement in the Vice’s exhibition; though, this has not been substantiated and is a massive generalization, as many exhibitions do not share our anatomy.</p>
                    <p>Exhibitions most commonly mimic animals—spanning the breadth of the animal kingdom from mammals to reptiles to insects and everything in between—often preying on our innate fear of predators or even personal phobias. Less commonly, exhibitions extend beyond our zoological roster and present as amalgamations of multiple animals and can even mimic those found in science fiction and horror films. A Vice’s threat level typically informs the complexity and novelty of its exhibition.</p>
                    <p>Within the Branch Arena, patches can be summoned to fight the exhibition and threaten or destroy the Vice core. The form that patches take in production are more concrete and stable than the patches summoned during staging. If a patch is summoned during staging and the wielder is brought in as an Adjunct, the patch will already be active once they enter the Branch Arena. Learn more about the use of patches below in <a href="#options">Branch Options,</a> as well as <a href="./bodies.html#patches">AV and Patches</a>.</p>
                    <p>Any and all objects present in the Branch Arena can have an effect on and be used to defend or fight against the Vice's exhibition, though patches will always be the most efficient due to their molecular structure. This includes both the Host and Adjunct's extensions, meaning hand-to-hand combat can be an effective means of action if a patch cannot be summoned. This also means that these extensions can be affected and damaged by the Vice's exhibition.</p>
                    <p>If a Host or Adjunct's extension is damaged by the exhibition in the metaphysical realm, similar injuries are incurred in the corporeal realm, though they will be significantly less severe. For example, if a Host's bone is broken in the metaphysical realm, it can be presented as joint stiffness in the corporeal realm. The gap in severity varies from person to person, though Hosts tend to incur more serious injuries in the corporeal realm compared to Adjuncts.</p>
                    <p>If an Adjunct's extension is destroyed in the Branch Arena, they are immediately ejected. Due to the severity of the injuries incurred in the Branch Arena, they will quickly begin to see the effects of the Branch on their body through ailments such as deep bruises, lacerations, minor bone fractures or even acute illness. Vices do not typically destroy the Host's extension and tend to keep them trapped in the Branch Arena so as to not risk interference as they continue germination.</p>

                </div>
                <h2 id="exhibitions">Exhibitions</h2>
                <p>Within the Branch Arena, a Host and their Adjunct(s) are pitted against the Vice’s exhibition, a creature-like visage that shields the Vice’s core from attacks. When a Branch is in production, the most surefire way to address the Branch is to either damage or destroy the Vice’s core, which entails sparring with the Vice’s exhibition.</p>
                <p>The exhibition houses the Vice’s core, which is stored in the same place for every Branch. Hosts and Adjuncts can use hand-to-hand combat to damage the core, but, if established, their patches are much more efficient. Patches are created to be direct counters to a Host’s exhibition; for example, if a Vice’s exhibition has a thick hide, a piercing patch is likely to be summoned. Learn more about patches in <a href="./bodies.html#patches">AV and Patches</a>.</p>
                <p>Exhibitions are capable of resembling anything the mind can conjure, though they typically resemble predatory animals or grotesque amalgamations akin to monsters in horror movies. Exhibitions can be as small as an armadillo or tower over a house. Size and complexity do have limits, however, typically capped by the Vice’s energy reserves. Some classifications prioritize complex and grand exhibitions, while others prefer to focus on germination.</p>
                <p>The characteristics of an exhibition are largely determined at advent, either pulling from internalized fears or from the Host’s experience during advent, both of which can influence the exhibition’s textures, body composition, and even smell. Exhibitions do not have to be bipedal, nor do they even need to have legs at all. Exhibitions can have wings, tails, spines, multiple sets of eyes, multiple heads, or multiple sets of limbs. Exhibitions can mimic insects, aquatic animals, birds, and even extinct species or creatures from pop culture like kaiju or cryptids. The possibilities truly are endless.</p>
                <p>Most exhibitions remain largely the same throughout a Vice’s life cycle, only increasing in efficiency and complexity as it matures. Larval exhibitions tend to be less detailed, and focus more on conveying the concept, rather than perfecting its execution. As the Vice matures, the exhibition tends to increase in complexity and efficiency, rerouting energy sources to contribute to enhanced stats, depending on the Vice’s classification. For example, Zeta Vices prioritize defenses, so its protective blubbery layer may thicken with maturity.</p>
                <p>Typically, Vices do not make drastic changes to their exhibitions between Branches, as it is an energy-intensive task to perform; though, some classifications have perfected the ability and are known for doing so, namely Delta and Epsilon Vices. Learn more about the differing exhibition properties between classifications in Classifying Vices.</p>
                <p>Exhibitions also influence blights, and characteristics observed in the Branch Arena can be seen mirrored in the Host, manifested through blights. For example, if a Vice’s exhibition has horns, is covered in scales, and can spit acid, the Host is likely to have similar horns, patches of scales, and acidic saliva. Blights do not damage the Host, but can cause damage after leaving the Host; in the case of acidic saliva, it will not harm the Host when the saliva is in their mouth, but if they spit it out, it might be able to corrode substances. VG tend to form a protective layer around blights, but dissipate after breaking contact with the Host. After the layer of VG has dispersed, the acidic saliva will then begin to corrode its surroundings.</p>
                <h3>Exhibition Classifications</h3>
                <p>Branch Analysts have devised broad categories for documentation and preparatory purposes. These categories largely influence treatment plans and help agents prepare plans of attack.</p>
                <p>While size is not necessarily indicative of threat level, larger exhibitions often require a larger treatment team. Size in this instance refers to height, not weight. Exhibition sizes are categorized using the following prefixes:</p>
                <div class="desc-list desc-list--grid">
                  <dl>
                    <div class="description-block">
                      <dt>Micro-</dt>
                      <dd>Micro-exhibitions are at most two feet tall; Hosts can typically address these exhibitions alone</dd>

                      <dd>Meso-exhibitions are between two and five feet tall; Hosts will benefit from the help of at least one Adjunct, typically two</dd>
                    </div>
                    <div class="description-block">
                      <dt>Macro-</dt>
                      <dd>Macro-exhibitions are between five and eight feet tall; Hosts will benefit from the help of at least three Adjuncts</dd>
                    </div>
                    <div class="description-block">
                      <dt>Giga-</dt>
                      <dd>Giga-exhibitions are eight feet or taller; Hosts will likely need a large, curated team of at least five Adjuncts</dd>
                    </div>
                  </dl>
                </div>
                <p>Exhibitions can also be classified by their prioritized stats. This classification informs the types of patches needed for efficiently addressing the Branch, and helps agents better formulate their plans of attack. The core purpose of exhibitions is to trap a Host and their Adjuncts in the Branch Arena as the core pursues germination. The method in which they are able to do so is indicated by these categories.</p>
                <div class="desc-list">
                  <dl>
                    <div class="description-block">
                      <dt>Offensive</dt>
                      <dd>Many offensive exhibitions prioritize attack over defense, and are typically “glass cannons” in that regard. They hit hard, but they are likely unable to take a hit. Some offensive exhibitions put resources in speed at the expense of their attack, but still prioritize attack. An offensive exhibition’s plan is to damage the Host and Adjuncts early so they are unable to fight back.</dd>
                    </div>
                    <div class="description-block">
                      <dt>Defensive</dt>
                      <dd>Defensive exhibitions typically do not focus on attacking extensions; rather, their aim is to put so much stock in their defense that the Host and Adjuncts are unable to make considerably progress in a timely manner, essentially trapping them in the Branch Arena as the Vice pursues germination.</dd>
                    </div>
                    <div class="description-block">
                      <dt>Hasty</dt>
                      <dd>These speedy exhibitions prioritize confusion and frustration with a “death by a thousand cuts” plan of attack. While these exhibitions typically cannot hit hard, they hit often and avoid attacks with their elusive dodging. Some hasty exhibitions go so far as to even avoid combat altogether, hiding amongst detailed Branch Arenas.</dd>

                      <dd>Regarded as the “jack of all trades” classification, these exhibitions are actually the most dangerous, as they are able to switch plans of attack an active Branch in reaction to the Host’s strategy. If a Host and Adjuncts are on the offensive, it can prioritize defenses, and switch to a hasty or offensive approach after they have been worn down. Balanced exhibitions are often macro- or giga-exhibitions and typically require larger treatment teams with the added support of a Solutions Architect.</dd>

                <h2 id="options">Branch Options</h2>
                <p>Extensions are presented with three options when experiencing a Branch:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li><b>Suspend:</b> threaten the Vice core during staging</li>
                  <li><b>Commit:</b> damage the Vice core during production</li>
                  <li><b>Rescind:</b> destroy the Vice core during production</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Suspend</h3>
                <p>Suspending a Branch requires threatening the Vice’s core during staging. What constitutes as “threatening” varies greatly between Hosts, though it usually involves overwhelming the advancing core with a burst of AV while the Branch is being staged.</p>
                <p>Suspension is typically achieved in one of two ways, either by using a patch or an AVShot to facilitate this “burst” of AV. A bludgeoning patch is less “damaging” to the Host and tends to threaten the Vice core easier due to the burst of AV from contact. Piercing and slashing patches are more concentrated and need to cut quite deep in order to threaten the core, which also runs the risk of prompting fusion if the patch comes too close. Branches can be suspended either by the Host themself or by any potential Adjuncts. While AVShots are not widely available, CVRS agents can administer them en lieu of using a patch, which is the recommended method of suspension. The rush of AV works to threaten the Vice much in the same way a burst of AV from a patch would.</p>
                <p>A Vice will also terminate the Branch if the Host loses consciousness during staging, either from natural causes or as the direct result of the damage incurred from a patch. It is not uncommon for bludgeoning patches to result in a loss of consciousness before the Vice is officially threatened, as the bursts of AV combined with repeated blunt trauma are typically enough to render the Host unconscious. For this reason, we recommend using an AVShot rather than attempting suspension with a patch.</p>
                <p>Suspending, compared to committing, is often regarded as a reckless approach with many downsides, some of which are explored above. This is because suspension:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>reduces the time until the next potential Branch; for example, If a Host was to commit a Branch, it might be half a year until the next Branch initiation, but if that same Branch was suspended, another Branch could be initiated in less than a month.</li>
                  <li>does not reduce the size of the core; any growth pursued during staging is merely paused, rather than destroyed</li>
                  <li>aids in the reproduction of Vices; in the event of an amateur suspension, using a patch to induce suspension often works to actually spread VG, compared to attacking the core in the confines of the Branch Arena. This is particularly due to the fact that bludgeoning patches are the recommended patch type to perform suspension.</li>
                  <li>exposes the Host to unnecessary bodily harm; regardless of the suspension approach, some degree of harm must be imparted on the Host’s body in order to be successful. Even if an AVShot is used en lieu of a patch, the Host’s body still has the strain of losing consciousness.</li>
                  <li>agitates the Vice and can lead to rogue Branches or changes in Branch formula; Vices tend to not react well to surprises and interference, also observed in their negative reactions to instigated Branches</li>
                  <li>degrades patches much quicker than wielding within the Branch Arena</li>
                  <li>risks core fusion if utilizing a piercing or slashing patch to perform suspension</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Due to these downsides, suspension should only be performed as a last resort after it is determined that more help or time are needed.</p>
                <h3>Commit</h3>
                <p>The circumstances around commits are fairly lenient, so long as the core is damaged during the production phase of an active Branch: commits can be performed by an Adjunct or the Host themself in the metaphysical realm using any means necessary, including patches, the Host or Adjuncts’ bare hands, or even objects found in the Branch Arena.</p>
                <p>The degree of damage required to prompt Branch termination varies between classifications and even between individual Vices. Some are more quick to concede after minimal damage, while others require more substantial damage. Vices with a low threat level tend to be more reactive, while Vices with a higher threat level tend to be more intentional.</p>
                <p>In the metaphysical realm, Vices house their core in their exhibition, which acts as a dense barrier between its core and the Host, Adjuncts and patches. Exhibitions react to and can be damaged by patches, where contact between the two typically results in a burst of energy that depletes the level of VG in the exhibition and the AV in the patch. Repeated manual combat can also damage an exhibition, though it is less efficient. Because both the exhibition and patches lose density and become less effective over time, technique and discernment are encouraged so as to not render patches useless during a Branch. Patches can be restored, though this is a timely process and not something many can afford to do during Branches. Despite repeated exposure, manual combat does not lose its effectiveness over time and is considered a suitable backup in the event of ineffective patches.</p>
                <p>Damaging the core outside of the Branch Arena runs the risk of not only inciting a Branch if one isn't already active, but prompting the Vice to fuse parts of its core with the Host as a defense mechanism. Learn more about this and other defense mechanisms in <a href="./bio.html#defense">Reactivity and Defense Mechanisms</a>.</p>
                <p>When a Branch is successfully committed, due to the damage to the core, a Vice retracts its germination tracks and reroutes the energy to focus on repair, often destroying potential germination routes in the process. The more damage done to the core, the longer between consecutive Branches.</p>
                <p>The act of committing a Branch is more productive than suspending a Branch for the following reasons:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Committing a Branch can actually result in a Vice losing progress, whereas suspending a Branch merely halts its progress; some more aggressive commits have been shown to reduce a Vice core by nearly half</li>
                  <li>This lost progress buys a Host more time between Branches as it focuses on repair</li>
                  <li>Branches provide the Host and any primary or secondary Adjuncts present with valuable information that can aid in a successful rescission, whereas suspending a Branch before it begins doesn’t allow the Host time to gather any new information</li>
                  <li>Repeated summoning within the Branch Arena bolsters and solidifies patch markup, allowing for minor enhancements between Branches</li>
                </ul>
                <h3 id="rescission">Rescind</h3>
                <p>Rescinding a Branch is the act of destroying a Vice core, ultimately killing the Vice. Rescission is a difficult process that requires strength, discernment, and precision. Weaker and more imprecise blows will merely damage the core and trigger the Vice to terminate the Branch before substantial progress can be made. Terminating a Branch requires energy, so if the core is damaged enough before it can react, it will be unable to terminate the Branch and the core can be completely destroyed. The Host and Adjuncts will need to utilize the observations and information gathered in previous Branches to prepare the most efficient and extensive plan of attack. <a href="./classes.html">Classifying Vices</a> briefly outlines tactics for rescinding the various classifications.</p>
                <p>Having a diverse team of support for rescission is highly recommended, as the varying patches and vantage points offer a multitude of approaches. While the Host’s patch is typically crafted as a bespoke weapon to combat their Vice’s exhibition, sometimes a multi-tool approach needs to be implemented for more complex or defensive exhibitions. Solutions Architects are CVRS agents trained to detect weaknesses in a Vice’s exhibition, and can be a valuable addition to a Host’s treatment team.</p>
                <p>If you have been admitted for care with a CVRS team, there are different rescission approaches available depending on the severity of your Vice classification.</p>
                <h4>Standard Rescission</h4>
                <p>Most care teams recommend pursuing standard rescission after enough information has been collected from documenting multiple committed Branches. Standard rescission entails outlining a game plan with a Vice Management Specialist and any other agents deemed necessary for success, then instigating a Branch with the intent to perform rescission. This method historically has the highest rates of success for multiple reasons:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Vices with a lower threat level are typically caught off guard, leading to shorter staging periods and consequently less complex Branch Arenas and exhibitions</li>
                  <li>Rescission allows the care team to witness the destruction of the Vice core firsthand to confidently classify the Host as cleared</li>
                  <li>The rate of re-ignition is typically much lower</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Standard rescission is only performed after committing a series of Branches. After the care team has committed enough Branches and feels confident in their assessment, the final Branch will be instigated with the intent to rescind the Vice. While typically instigated by a Vice Management Specialist, other agents such as Branch Admins, Branch Coordinators or Solutions Architects may be included. Pseudo Adjuncts from the Research sector may sit in for observational purposes as well.</p>
                <p>Standard rescission is only performed through a Primary Care team at a CVRS station. While Branch Admins in Urgent Care and Public Deployment are trained and able to rescind, their main focus is to take control of the situation and safely address the Branch in a timely matter. Learn more about the roles of these agents in <a href="./cvrs.html#roles">Agent Roles and Responsibilities</a>.</p>
                <h4>Exposure Rescission</h4>
                <p>For Vices that are more conservative in initiating Branches and makes regular commits difficult, a Host can be placed on a weekly regimen of AVShots, with the size of the Vice core monitored by post-treatment VGMS. Over time, the regular AVShots will eat away at the core until the sheer volume of AV in the final shot overwhelms and destroys the core, rescinding the Vice and establishing the Host as cleared after their status is verified with a VGMS. Because of the high possibility of instigated Branches, AVShots are administered in CVRS observation chambers, and a care team is on standby to address the potential Branch. Hosts that do not immediately react are sent to Urgent Care to be monitored until the AV levels equalize, then the Host is discharged.</p>
                <p>The weekly schedule of exposure rescission is as such to give the Host's body time to rest and recover between doses. While AV is naturally produced by our bodies, regular exposure to the exacerbated levels produced by AVShots can have adverse effects, such as lowered immune function and tissue damage in addition to prompting more common rogue Branches as the Vice attempts to regain control.</p>
                <p>Depending on the size and activity of the Vice core, treatment can span anywhere from two months to half a year. A Vice Management Specialist may recommend a break from treatment if the Host begins having adverse reactions or the Vice begins fighting back. If a Branch is committed, treatment can be skipped for the week, as the effects of AVShots are typically similar in their efficacy.</p>
                <p>Exposure rescission is often regarded with caution and even skepticism, as many agents remark false negatives in the VGMS administered after the final shot. While the VGMS may register the core as destroyed, oftentimes core fragments are still circulating through the Host's body and re-congeal after AV levels have stabilized. Many agents recommend a holistic approach that combines exposure rescission with standard rescission, leaving the final instigated Branch to be rescinded in the Branch Arena where the core destruction is indisputable.</p>
                <h4>Manual Rescission</h4>
                <p>When a Vice is particularly reactive to AVShots and tend toward dangerous, complex Branches, manual rescission may be performed; however, this experimental approach is widely regarded as hazardous, and the results are dubious at best. Manual rescission entails physically extracting the Vice core from the Host's body in a surgical procedure while a Branch is in production. The parameters for theoretical success are as follows:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>A Branch must be in production, as doing so outside of a Branch runs the risk of the core permanently fusing with the Host's flesh as a defense mechanism, which can damage vital organs or muscles; if the Branch is in staging, the agent performing the procedure runs the risk of being pulled in as an adjunct, even with protective Summoning Gloves, as direct contact with the core can sometimes be strong enough to overpower the coating of AV</li>
                  <li>Because of the Branch requirement, the Host must be conscious, as Branches cannot be instigated or maintained if the Host is unconscious; this necessitates the use of local anesthesia rather than general</li>
                  <li>The Host must be stable, as the core in a berserk or comatose Host has already begun fusing with the Host's flesh and manually separating the two is nearly impossible</li>
                  <li>The core cannot be damaged during the procedure, otherwise the Branch will be terminated and committed before rescission can occur; after the Branch has been committed, the core will likely begin fusing with the Host's body in retaliation, as mentioned in point one</li>
                </ul>
                <p>As seen above, the requirements for a successful rescission are difficult and can be costly to achieve, and the rate of success has not been determined. The question of who performs the procedure is a point of contention, as well. A licensed surgeon will likely have a more steady hand and a better grasp of human anatomy, while a CVRS agent will have a better grasp of Vice anatomy and know how to properly and efficiently extract the whole of the core without damage.</p>
                <p>For now, this approach is deemed experimental and should only be performed as a last result or in dire circumstances when all other approaches have failed.</p>
                <h2 id="adjuncts">The Role of Adjuncts</h2>
                <p>While it is possible to address Branches alone, many Hosts benefit from the support that Adjuncts can offer. Adjuncts can increase the success rates, typically by strengthening defenses, increasing firepower, or even serving as a distraction. Depending on their relationship with the Host, Adjuncts can be classified as primary, secondary, or tertiary, abbreviated as p!Adjunct, s!Adjunct, and t!Adjunct, respectively. Primary and secondary Adjuncts are queued during staging via physical touch, while tertiary Adjuncts are brought in during staging by a Vice extending its tracks. Adjuncts are admitted to production after the Host has entered the Branch Arena. Primary and secondary Adjuncts must maintain contact with the Host during both staging and production. Due to their lack of contact, tertiary Adjuncts are often dismissed from Branches.</p>
                <div class="desc-list">

                        <dt>Tertiary Adjunct <span class="extra">(t!Adjunct)</span></dt>
                        <dd>Tertiary Adjuncts are a relatively rare phenomenon, and are often unassuming strangers brought into Branches by a Vice to throw off the Host and increase energy consumption if a Vice is confident in reaching dispersion. These Adjuncts are typically only associated with specific Vice classifications, such as Theta Vices, or intelligent, calculating Vices, as the act of queuing tertiary Adjuncts is quite energy-intensive. The Vice extends its tracks to latch on to those within the staging radius, though the connection is weak during staging and can be easily lost, so Vices tend to employ this tactic right before production. After these Adjuncts are admitted to the Branch Arena, their connection is somewhat solidified, though still relatively easy to break free from, which often occurs before the Branch is addressed. Tertiary Adjuncts cannot summon patches in the Branch Arena due to this weak connection. A Vice is also capable of easily expelling a tertiary Adjunct if they become too much of a threat.</dd>
                    </div>
                    <div class="description-block">
                      <dt>Secondary Adjunct <span class="extra">(s!Adjunct)</span></dt>
                      <dd>Secondary Adjuncts are the most common, spanning anywhere from someone who is attending a Host's Branch for the first time to people who have been admitted to over five. These Adjuncts are intentionally brought into Branches via physical touch while the Branch is being staged. Secondary Adjuncts are capable of summoning patches and are less likely to be dismissed, though it is still possible for less experienced Adjuncts. The more often a secondary Adjunct is brought in, the stronger the connection becomes. Though the number varies between Hosts, after a secondary Adjunct has made several contributions to the success of Branches, be it analyzing the Branch formula or facilitating commits, they are reclassified as a primary Adjunct. The number of Branches an Adjunct has been admitted to does not determine their classification; rather, their connection to the Host and situational awareness within the Branch Arena sets these Adjuncts apart.</dd>
                    </div>
                    <div class="description-block">
                      <dt>Primary Adjunct <span class="extra">(p!Adjunct)</span></dt>
                      <dd>Primary Adjuncts have regularly aided in committing Branches for a Host and have a firm grasp of the Branch Formula. Because of this, primary Adjuncts are less common, but they are invaluable during Branches and rescission, especially. Many Vice Management Specialists quickly become a primary Adjunct for their patients after thorough analysis of their Branch formula. Due to their stronger connection, Primary Adjuncts are more difficult to dismiss, have a boost to their patch's efficacy, and have a higher success rate when forcing entry with a Backdoor. Trust and confidence are integral in setting primary Adjuncts apart and play a large role in bolstering their connection to the Host during Branches. Because of this bond, primary Adjuncts are often able to perform fringe actions with the Host, such as merging patches, forcing entry, and even summoning <a href="#reformation">reformed Vices</a> more easily.</dd>

                    <div class="description-block">
                      <dt>Pseudo Adjuncts</dt>
                      <dd>While not common in everyday Branches, CVRS utilizes pseudo Adjuncts to observe Branches from a distance and document Vice behavior and Branch properties. Solutions Architects in particular are brought in to detect weaknesses in a Vice's exhibition and pick up on patterns in early Branches, relaying this information to Vice Management Specialists and Branch Admins. These agents are able to join Branches via proximity, using modified Backdoors with a lower electrical charge. This lower charge and their lack of contact with the Host result in a fairly weak but nearly undetectable presence in the Branch. Most Vices do not notice a pseudo Adjunct's presence in the Branch Arena as their visage is often nearly transparent and amorphous. They also cannot have a direct impact on the Branch and are only able to communicate with the primary and secondary Adjuncts using a MobiComm.</dd>
                    </div>
                  </dl>
                </div>
                <h3>Queuing</h3>
                <p>The process of admitting primary and secondary Adjuncts to a Branch is not unlike a queue, where making contact with the Host is similar to reserving one's space in line. Two factors are considered in the queuing process: the time that contact is made, and the point of contact's proximity to the core in the Host's body. The sooner an Adjunct makes and maintains contact with the Host during staging, and the closer an Adjunct's point of contact to the core, the sooner they will be brought in at the start of production. If contact is interrupted, the Adjunct is sent to the back of the queue and will likely take more in-Branch time to be brought in. Even if a Branch moves into production, Adjuncts stay in the queue until they are admitted based on these factors. If the Branch is committed or rescinded while an Adjunct is in the queue, they are simply dismissed from the Branch. Adjuncts can be admitted simultaneously, though priority is typically given to primary Adjuncts.</p>
                <p>If an unpredictable Branch has been initiated and all Adjuncts do not have time to make contact with the Host, making contact with each other will suffice, so long as at least one Adjunct is in contact with the Host. Doing so creates a staggered queuing effect of bringing in Adjuncts, where Adjuncts that are two or three times removed from the Host can take up to an hour of in-Branch time to be brought in.</p>
                <h3>Adjunct Benefits</h3>
                <p>The chart below shows how the number of secondary Adjuncts present in the Branch Arena increases the chances of success. The higher the threat level, the more Adjuncts required for higher rates of success. This increase rate of success extends to both committing and rescinding Branches.</p>

Likewise, if you have a Vice with a high threat level and two Adjuncts, one primary, the other secondary, your chances of success increase by 22.86% instead of 18.66%.</p>
                <h2 id="fringe">Fringe Branch Events</h2>
                <p>While Branches of all kinds share the same three phases, there are some situations that can disrupt the expected flow.</p>
                <h3>Rogue Branches</h3>
                <p>When Vices deviate from an established Branch formula and incite Branches unexpectedly, these are referred to as "rogue" Branches, observed primarily in aggressive adolescent Vices with a medium or high threat level. Rogue Branches are typically incited when a Vice is agitated, threatened or compromised&mdash;for example, AVShots are generally considered threatening, as they inhibit growth and attack the Vice's core.</p>
                <p>Hosts who progress to the berserk phase during an active Branch are at risk of experiencing rogue Branches after the current Branch has been addressed, especially if the Host is infected with an adolescent Vice. Experts posit this is due to the drastic increase in growth, and the Vice is having trouble regulating itself after the fact. Mature and larval Vices are less likely to partake in this behavior, though it cannot be fully ruled out as a possibility.</p>
                <p>Rogue Branches can also be influenced by drastic changes in the natural environment, such as fluctuating electromagnetic fields or gas leaks, though this is far less common. Dense concentrations of VG, either from a detached repo or recent dispersion, also tend to excite or agitate Vices and result in rogue Branches, most commonly seen in those with a lower threat level.</p>
                <p>Hosts experiencing a rogue Branch are more likely to appear agitated during staging, with about 85% of Hosts being agitated and only 15% being lethargic, compared to the 50-50 split for standard Branches. If a Host is uncharacteristically agitated during staging when they are usually lethargic, this is likely indicative of a rogue Branch. Hosts who are typically agitated during standard Branches will also appear agitated during rogue Branches. The small percentage of hosts that are lethargic for both Branch types typically have a Delta, Zeta, or Theta Vice.</p>
                <h3>Forcing Entry</h3>
                <p>Adjuncts are able to force their way into a Branch in production with the use of a Backdoor, a taser-like device issued to agents with higher experience levels. A Backdoor attracts and rekindles any stray tracks in the Host's network to provide a path to enter the initiated Branch, bypassing the queuing process, with an admission rate of roughly 72%. Side effects include mild electrostatic shock, headaches, tinnitus, and lockjaw, and run the risk of inducing seizures if used too often or incorrectly. Weak tracks account for the 28% of failed admissions, as the Backdoor overloads the track and destroys the connections between the VN.</p>
                <p>Upon entry, the agent's extension is weak, and contact must be made with the Host in order to maintain and strengthen the connection and efficiently contribute to the Branch. Forcing oneself into a Branch can be painful for the agent, Host or any Adjuncts involved if Backdoors are used too often or incorrectly, as some Vices have been known to redirect the electrostatic charge if it comes to expect it. If used outside of an active Branch, Backdoors have been known to instigate Branches. While forcing entry can be the difference between life or death, it must only be performed after careful consideration and in the case of emergencies.</p>
                <h3>Instigation</h3>
                <p>While Branches are typically initiated as a way for Vices to expand their core, Branches can also be initiated by a Host or Adjuncts with the intent to study or rescind the Vice. Instigation is achieved by overloading stray tracks in the Vice's network, sending an electrostatic charge directly back to the Vice core. This process is most commonly performed by a Primary Care team in the CVRS observation chambers by administering a concentrated electrostatic charge while the care team is in contact with the Host. A Backdoor is also capable of initiating a Branch outside of a CVRS station if needed.</p>
                <p>Instigated Branches typically have a shorter staging time than usual, and the Vice's exhibition is often enraged upon entry, sometimes even deviating from its expected Branch formula. While rescinding an instigated Branch is not mandatory, repeated instigation can lead to rogue Branches and permanent changes in Branch formulae as the Vice adapts to the new threat. CVRS agents will not instigate a Branch unless they are intending to perform rescission, as they are advised to practice discernment.</p>
                <h3 id="reformation">Reformation</h3>
                <p>Reformation is the act of flipping the Vice-Host dynamic on its head. The relationship between a Host and their Vice is generally considered parasitic, posing no benefit to the Host, but after performing reformation, a Host is able to utilize their Vice's strength in the Branch Arena. The act of reformation entails the Host's extension consuming the Vice core during production. For reasons still being researched, doing so prompts the Host's body to slightly alter the genetic makeup of its AV so it becomes not the perfect opposite of VG, but a solvent that dissolves the Vice core and suspends its genetic material in fluid. In doing so, this genetic material is dispersed throughout the Host's body and remains in the system anywhere from as little as a year to 10 years, depending on maturity and core size. Hosts are not deemed cleared if this process has occurred, as the majority of the Vice core is still "alive" within the Host's body, and even poses the threat of congealing and reestablishing its form.</p>
                <h4>Factors of Success</h4>
                <p>The act of reformation is rather difficult to see through to completion. In some cases, Hosts who intend to reform their Vice fail to do so properly and subject themselves to longer Branch times, actually allowing the Vice core to spread further than it would if the Branch had been properly committed or rescinded in a timely manner.</p>
                <p>If a Host intends to reform their Vice, they must be able to incapacitate the Vice's exhibition without prompting it to terminate the Branch. Vices terminate Branches when their core has been damaged, which makes incapacitating the exhibition so the core can be accessed the first hurdle. If the Vice core sustains enough damage in the incapacitation process, the Branch will be committed before reformation can occur. If the exhibition is successfully incapacitated, the second hurdle is consuming enough of the core in a single bite that the Vice doesn't have enough energy left to terminate the Branch. Too small of a bite can simply damage the core and render the Branch committed. Though, if these two requirements are met, the Host can finish consuming the core.</p>
                <h4>Benefits</h4>
                <p>Successfully consuming the Vice core in the Branch Arena implies that the Host's body has altered its AV and begun dispersing the Vice core. After a period of roughly 24 hours, the Host can reap the benefits of a successful reformation.</p>
                <p>As an Adjunct, the Host will now be able to initiate a transformation, much in the same way a patch is summoned. This transformation alters the Host's extension to mimic that of their reformed Vice's exhibition. A complete transformation takes roughly five minutes of in-Branch time and can be paused at different stages. This transformation depletes the levels of the Vice core in the Host's body, so some Hosts intentionally pause the transformation during an intermediate stage to reap the benefits, but extend the amount of time the benefits are available to them. This transformation, if brought to completion, results in a direct one-to-one copy of the Vice's exhibition, retaining its size, strength, speed, and defense.</p>
                <h4>Risks</h4>
                <p>Reformation, while touting promising benefits, is an unreliable and imprecise process that poses the risk of being reversed without the Host's knowledge. Over time, the altered AV can break down and free the Vice core compounds. If enough of these compounds are freed, they can merge and begin establishing a stationary mass as it was before reformation. With enough time, this mass becomes the Vice core once again, and threatens rogue Branches, often deviating from its original Branch formula. Reformation also results in more aggressive Blights, typically experienced in sudden, explosive reactions as the Host's body learns how to respond to the new substance flowing throughout it. While the act of reformation is regarded as a noble endeavor to help fellow Hosts, this process should be avoided until further research is conducted and a more stable approach can be implemented.</p>
