                <h2 id="classes">Primary Classes</h2>
                <p>Primary classes serve to inform Hosts of their Vice’s expected behavior. A Vice's classification is synonymous with its primary class. Each class explored below contains brief guidance on approaching rescission. We recommend that all Hosts, regardless of their Vice’s threat level, seek counsel and treatment from a CVRS team.</p>
                <p>Classification is not an instantaneous process. Multiple appointments and consultations with a Record Proctor may be required to perform accurate classification.</p>
                <p>Alpha Vices are generally considered the initial pool from which all other Vices evolved and deviated. Beta, Lambda, and Xi Vices are thought to be the first deviations from the Alpha classification and are often misclassified as such due to the similarities they share.</p>

                </div>
                <p>Alpha Vices are the most common and easiest to treat due to their shared Branch Ops of 1) a sudden advent, 2) non-threatening blights, and 3) regular, predictable Branches. Alpha Vices rarely progress past the adolescent stage and only occasionally result in berserk Hosts, as their Branches are typically straightforward and easy to commit or even rescind. Alpha Vices account for the large majority of Vices at roughly 65% of all documented and classified Vices.</p>
                <p>These Vices rarely exhibit a level of intelligence that suggests planning, observation or even learning, as these Vices tend to be impulsive, but predictable. A Host with an Alpha Vice is typically able to quickly recognize its most common triggers that often resemble those found at advent, find weak spots in its exhibition, and pursue rescission without much interference.</p>
                <p>While self-rescission is achievable, we always recommend meeting with a Vice Management Administrator to aid in the process and improve rates of success.</p>
                <h4>Rescinding Alpha Vices</h4>
                <p>Alpha Vices typically have compact, offensive meso- and macro-exhibitions. Alpha cores are commonly housed in the thickest part of the exhibition, tending most often toward the chest and head. These cores are usually no larger than 25mm and are easily rescinded with a couple efficient blows. Patches that emulate both piercing and blunt weapons are most effective at damaging the sturdy exhibition. Alpha Vice cores tend to allow for excessive damage to the core before terminating Branches, which presents the opportunity for an efficient rescission if prepared.</p>
                <hr class="dashed">
                <div class="heading-group heading-group--label">
                    <h3 id="beta">Beta</h3>
                    <span class="label label--gold">Medium</span>
                </div>
                <p>Beta Vices tend to have a gradual advent, more aggressive blights, and a higher chance of rogue Branches, leading many to view them as the more intelligent, “evolved” version of Alpha Vices. Many are incorrectly classified as Alpha Vices in early treatment, catching Hosts by surprise when Branches deviate from expected norms. This often results in berserk Hosts, but these Branches are typically no more complex than those found in Alpha Vices. The key to identifying Beta Vices lies in its behavior outside of Branches, paying special attention to blights. Within the Branch Domain, Alpha and Beta Vices are quite similar and can be approached with similar strategies.</p>
                <p>Aggressive blights suggest that these Vices prioritize growth and are often found expanding even outside of the Branch Domain. Because Beta Vices are typically more threatening than Alpha Vices, we recommend regular appointments with a Vice Management Administrator, who may enlist the support of a <a href="./cvrs.html#branch-coordinator">Branch Coordinator</a> or <a href="./cvrs.html#blight-specialist">Blight Specialist</a>.</p>
                <h4>Rescinding Beta Vices</h4>
                <p>Beta exhibitions are traditionally taller than Alpha exhibitions and further lean into their offensive tendencies, resulting in stronger upper bodies. Beta cores are commonly kept in more high-traffic areas like the exhibition’s knees, elbows or tail and are slightly larger than Alpha cores, at roughly 35mm. Patches that mimic long-range weapons are considered the “safest” approach but require precision and practice, which can be found with the help of a Vice Management Administrator. Beta Vices are typically more sensitive and terminate Branches quicker, which can complicate rescissions and call for more concentrated, intentional attacks.</p>
                <hr class="dashed">
                <div class="heading-group heading-group--label">
                    <h3 id="delta">Delta</h3>
                    <span class="label label--green">Low</span>
                </div>
                <p>Delta Vices are fairly uncommon and tricky to treat, as their cores undergo the unique process of “shedding”, wherein the Vice abandons the germination progress made since advent or its last shed. Shedding is essentially a reset in Branch Ops; the exhibition stays roughly the same between sheds, while triggers and Branch Domains can shift drastically. This is a time- and energy-intensive process where the Vice sacrifices its recently-obtained growth to fuel the shed. This process seemingly occurs at random, though some have been observed shedding as a direct response to threats, such as a significant decrease in availability of desired hormones. Shedding essentially causes a Vice to regress back to the larval stage. Because of this process, Hosts rarely become berserk. Compared to other classifications, Delta Vices seem much less concerned with achieving dispersion and are focused more on prolonging their individual lives, which drastically reduces their threat level. The rate at which Delta Vices shed varies between Hosts, as it can happen yearly, monthly, or even weekly.</p>
                <p>A common side effect of shedding is memory loss, wherein the Host loses memories encoded during the time period of the progress that is shed. In extreme cases, memory loss can extend outside of the established growth period, though this is extremely rare and typically indicative of an underlying memory issue.</p>
                <p>Many Delta Vices are born from a gradual advent, though sudden advents have been documented. This is the rare occasion of gradual advents providing more clarity in Branch Ops, as Delta Vices with a gradual advent tend to pull properties from the advent period to fuel the Branch Ops of the various shifts. Delta Vices with a sudden advent only tend to mimic the properties of advent in their initial Branch Ops, and those after shedding tend to pull from non-advent experiences.</p>
                <p>Due to their regular regression to the larval stage, Delta Vices spend the majority of their time feeding, and Branches only begin to occur as they mature toward adolescence, leading to a lower rate of Branch initiation. The regular cycling paired with near-constant feeding often result in a Host's exhaustion and frustration, driving them to seek treatment via rescission. Delta Vices are typically easily rescinded shortly after shedding, though its Branch Ops are not established and should be approached with caution. We recommend initiating care when you first recognize that shedding has occurred.</p>
                <h4>Rescinding Delta Vices</h4>
                <p>A Delta Vice’s Branch Ops tend to change throughout a its life cycle, but this shift only occurs at the expense of the Vice’s maturity. Delta Vices are most vulnerable after shedding, as they are the least mature and have little to no resources to stage a complex Branch or construct an intimidating exhibition, which are typically small and stout, categorized as hasty micro- and meso-exhibitions. We recommend rescinding with a Vice Management Administrator and <a href="./cvrs.html#branch-admin">Branch Administrator</a> who can attack the exhibition using brute force. A <a href="./cvrs.html#solutions-arch">Solutions Architect</a> is often employed to analyze the unfamiliar Branch Domain.</p>
                <hr class="dashed">
                <div class="heading-group heading-group--label">
                    <h3 id="epsilon">Epsilon</h3>
                    <span class="label label--red">High</span>
                </div>
                <p>Also quite rare, Epsilon Vices are much harder to treat because of their deceptive nature. While a Delta Vice sheds it core and regresses to the larval stage, Epsilon Vices keep their core, and efficiently utilize their energy reserves to change their exhibitions or Branch Ops on a whim, between random Branches and without warning. These deceptive maneuvers are not random, and are intentionally deployed to avoid accurate classification early on and ultimately discourage rescission. For example, if a Host seems to have a firm grasp of triggers and has been successfully avoiding them, an Epsilon Vice could initiate rogue Branches that directly contradict their supposed triggers. Because of this, these Vices are typically quite liberal in their Branch initiations, especially in the adolescent stage. Epsilon Vices are thought to be the evolved form of Delta Vices, as their “shifts” are more intentional and deceptive in nature, rather than random or reactive, and they do not have to sacrifice growth in order to do so.</p>
                <p>Epsilon Vices have mastered the art of efficient energy storage. Between Branches, these Vices prioritize either expanding their network or altering their exhibition and Branch Ops. Epsilon cores are often extremely dense due to this focus on expanding their track network rather than physically growing the core. When dispersion seems likely, it breaks off any unneeded tracks and diverts all resources to fuel exponential, sudden growth along the well-established network, which almost always pushes the Host into the berserk phase and triggers a Branch. Because the Host is often unprepared, Epsilon Vices are more likely to result in a comatose Host—and in extreme cases, dispersion—compared to other, less threatening classifications. <a href="#gamma">--gamma</a> subclasses often accompany Epsilon classifications, and repo establishment is often observed.</p>
                <p>When confronting an Epsilon Vice, being detail-oriented, calm and observant is key to a successful rescission. Though their exhibitions and triggers can change dramatically, there is typically a small, unifying characteristic that is often their weak point. We do not recommend attempting rescission alone. A highly-skilled team comprised of a Vice Management Administrator, Branch Administrator, and Solutions Architect are trained to address the deceptive nature of Epsilon Vices.</p>
                <h4>Rescinding Epsilon Vices</h4>
                <p>Epsilon exhibitions are typically smaller, but much more efficient, often categorized as hasty or balanced meso-exhibitions. They can change drastically between Branches without sacrificing complexity. It is important to pay attention to any changes in blights, as they can help signal coming changes in the next Branch. Epsilon Branch Domains are often challenging, utilizing designs that make classic combat difficult, such as tall, narrow domains or domains filled with obstacles. For this reason, we recommend acquiring a CVRS care team with a wide variety of patches to be prepared for these challenges. A Solutions Architect is trained to look for any similarities between exhibitions. These shared characteristics typically house the core. A Branch Administrator provides much needed offensive support, while a Vice Management Administrator who is familiar with your Vice will keep the team grounded.</p>
                <hr class="dashed">
                <div class="heading-group heading-group--label">
                    <h3 id="zeta">Zeta</h3>
                    <span class="label label--red">High</span>
                </div>
                <p>Zeta Vices are categorized by their excessive feeding in the larval stage, often driving Hosts to seek treatment early on. The <a href="#sigma">--sigma</a> subclass often accompanies Zeta classifications, and even those without the subclass tend to be relaxed in their preferences, consuming any and all hormones at their disposal. Because of this, Zeta Vices feed as much and as often as possible, growing quickly while also draining a Host in very observable ways. Zeta Vices are one of the few classifications to have such visible effects on a Host, usually in the form of drastic weight loss, pale skin, and exaggerated under-eye bags.</p>
                <p>Though many seek treatment in the larval stage, rescinding a Zeta Vices often poses a unique threat. These Vices are quite conservative in initiating Branches, and due to their immaturity, Hosts typically have not experienced many Branches—if any at all—so the Vice's properties are unknown. Zeta Vices utilize their excessive energy reserve in incredibly resourceful ways. They often craft complex Branch Domains, bolster their exhibition, and expel secondary Adjuncts to essentially trap their Hosts in the Branch Domain without any help as they expand their core. We recommend pursuing treatment shortly after classification is received so a robust care team can be constructed.</p>
                <h4>Rescinding Zeta Vices</h4>
                <p>Zeta exhibitions are often large and dense, classified most commonly as defensive macro- and giga-exhibitions. They typically have thick skin or scales and can have multiple layers of protective fat. Because of this, blunt patches are less effective and typically wear out before much progress is made. These exhibitions are not impenetrable, however, and can be perforated with a long-range piercing patch, such as a javelin. A Solutions Architect can help identify weak spots in the exhibition for a Vice Management Administrator or Branch Administrator to attack. Zeta cores are hearty and will endure a lot of damage before terminating the Branch, though this is not necessarily a benefit as it tends to be for other classifications, as inflicting repeated damage against the core is actually quite difficult to do in a timely manner. Because of this, Zeta Vices can be deadly if one does not have the proper resources, so we recommend reaching out to CVRS at the first sign of the symptoms listed above.</p>
                <hr class="dashed">
                <div class="heading-group heading-group--label">
                    <h3 id="theta">Theta</h3>
                    <span class="label label--gold">Medium</span>
                </div>
                <p>Theta Vices are the most chaotic of the Vices and deviate from any psychological norms that experts have observed. While many Vices are driven by survival, Theta Vices thrive on chaos and aim to consume as many victims as possible, often taking itself down in the process. Theta Vices behave much like Alpha Vices in their early larval stage, observed in a handful of regular, run-of-the-mill Branches. These Vices will typically enter a dormant phase where it prioritizes feeding to fill its energy reserves. If a supposed Alpha Vice suddenly stops regular Branches, seek a Vice Management Administrator immediately.</p>
                <p>After this feeding phase has completed, Hosts are then taken by surprise when their Theta Vice inevitably triggers an explosive, rogue Branch––typically in a public, crowded setting––that draws in numerous tertiary Adjuncts with its wider-than-average staging radius. Experts posit that this is an attempt to disorient and catch the Host off guard and maximize its energy consumption during dispersion.</p>
                <p>Though the chaotic nature of the rogue Branch is indeed dangerous, this is an extremely costly maneuver that often leaves Theta Vices brittle and susceptible to rescission, as the Vice has stretched itself extremely thin in its speedy attempt at germination. Regardless, Theta Vices are unpredictable, so we recommend pursuing treatment with a Vice Management Administrator and Branch Coordinator.</p>
                <h4>Rescinding Theta Vices</h4>
                <p>The key to successfully rescinding a Theta Vice lies in being prepared for its explosive rogue Branch. Theta exhibitions do typically mimic Alpha Vices, though they are often slimmer and quicker, with sharp accents such as claws, fangs and horns. Theta cores are most commonly found in the exhibition’s chest or torso and is typically a bit thicker than its appendages, making for an easy target, if you can catch it. Theta Vices typically have hasty micro- and meso-exhibitions that hinge on avoiding damage rather than inflicting it. If a supposed Alpha Vice uncharacteristically lulls in its regular Branch timing, seek help through CVRS, where a Vice Management Administrator can instigate the Branch before the Vice and catch it off guard. If the rogue Branch has been instigated publicly, a Branch Coordinator from <a href="./cvrs.html#public-deployment">Public Deployment</a> can help corral any tertiary Adjuncts. Regardless of who incited the Branch, Theta Vices are extremely sensitive and reactive to core damage, terminating Branches at the first sign of damage. Thankfully, due to their relatively brittle exhibitions, delivering devastating blows is relatively easy with the right tools.</p>

                    <h3 id="lambda">Lambda</h3>
                    <span class="label label--red">High</span>
                </div>
                <p>Lambda Vices are quite rare and start out overwhelming and unmanageable in a catastrophic event that launches the Host into a complex, high-energy Branch without warning. All Lambda Vices have am abnormally long gradual advent, wherein the fuel for this explosive Branch is being stockpiled. Due to the Host having no prior Branches to inform a plan of attack, these Branches typically take considerable time to address, often resulting in berserk or even comatose Hosts. Though, if successfully committed, Lambda Vices become easier to treat over time. Each Branch following the advent is less aggressive and less sudden and often follows the same Branch Ops of the rogue Branch experienced at advent, making for a straightforward rescission.</p>
                <p>Lambda Vices are very rarely a Host’s first Vice and are typically only birthed in a second or even third advent. Some experts believe that persistent pseudo-blights or the Host’s initial Vice being a Phi Vice are indicative of a potential Lambda advent, though not enough research on this subject exists due to this classification’s rarity.</p>
                <p>Because these advents are so sudden and drastic, many Hosts fall to their knees from fatigue upon Branch initiation, rather than slowly coming to a stop or zoning out. Host tend to be more active during Branch initiation in an almost seizure-like state as their body adjusts to the overwhelming changes. If you suspect a Lambda Vice advent is in effect, call your local Public Deployment team. Branch Administrators are best trained to address these aggressive rogue Branches.</p>
                <h4>Rescinding Lambda Vices</h4>
                <p>The key to a successful Lambda Vice rescission lies in the preparation. Because these are not often a Host’s first Vice, pay attention to the characteristics that could signal a potential Lambda advent, such as persistent pseudo-blights, perpetual lethargy after rescission, or a previous Phi classification. In rare instances, Hosts can manifest a vague attempt at a patch, despite not being infected. If this occurs, call your local CVRS immediately. Lambda exhibitions are similar in appearance to Theta Vices, with less emphasis on speed and more investment in strength, leading to top-heavy exhibitions, as with Beta Vices. They are often referred to as “glass cannons” and with quick thinking, these Vices can be rescinded. Lambda Vices are less reactive to damage and often allow for massive amounts of damage to the core before it terminates the Branch, often allowing for straightforward rescission if enough damage can be dealt. Experts believe they “know” subsequent Branches will be less effective and are more hesitant to terminate their initial Branch because of this. We implore passersby to immediately call your local Public Deployment Team to assist. Branch Administrators are typically successful with their use of brute force.</p>

                <div class="heading-group heading-group--label">
                  <h3 id="xi">Xi</h3>
                  <span class="label label--gold">Medium</span>
                </div>
                <p>Xi Vices are often misclassified as Alpha Vices due to the fact they start out quite manageable and routine, adhering to regular Branch Ops with a sudden advent and relatively standard blights. As the Vice matures, Branches gradually become more complex, exhibitions grow larger, and blights become threatening. While they increase in complexity over time, Xi Vices will always adhere to the Branch Ops established at advent, a welcomed constant among its shifting properties. Xi Vices are often considered the “opposite” of Lambda Vices.</p>
                <p>The key in differentiating Alpha and Xi Vices early on lies in the strict observance of the Vice’s Branch Ops. In their larval form, Alpha Vices prioritize feeding and are conservative in initiating Branches, while Xi Vices are more liberal in initiating Branches to experiment with their Branch Ops, leading to an unnaturally active larval stage. If an Xi Vice is misclassified as an Alpha Vice, its gradual increase in complexity is likely to catch the Host off guard, trapping them in a Branch Domain they are not equipped to address.</p>
                <p>Xi Branch Domains can quickly get out of hand if the Vice is allowed to mature to the adolescent stage, where rogue Branches are more likely. Adolescent Xi Vices can go from being relatively harmless to incredibly dangerous if not addressed in a timely manner.</p>
                <h4>Rescinding Xi Vices</h4>
                <p>The key to successfully rescinding an Xi Vices lies in a timely, prepared response. Xi exhibitions tend to grow and evolve during its life cycle as more Branches are allowed to enter production and often favor power as it matures, focusing on strength, resulting in an offensive exhibition that ranges anywhere from meso- to giga-exhibitions. If one suspects a Xi Vice is getting out of hand, suspension can be performed to provide the Host with time to gather the appropriate resources and enlist the support needed. A Vice Management Administrator is likely to work alongside a Solutions Architect, who is ready to analyze the changes in the Branch Domain and exhibition.</p>

                    <h3 id="phi">Phi</h3>
                    <span class="label label--green">Low</span>
                </div>
                <p>A somewhat uncommon and bizarre classification of Vice that is so chaotic and dysfunctional on a molecular level that it barely has enough energy to maintain the Branch initiated at its sudden advent. While its advent may be jarring and unexpected, it is nowhere near as dangerous as Lambda Vices, as seen through the disjointed and incoherent nature of the Branch. Additionally, the structural integrity of the exhibition is so poor that it can be rescinded without much effort. If the Branch is committed rather than rescinded, it will typically present as an Alpha Vice with a longer larval stage to bolster its frail exhibition and solidify its Branch Ops.</p>
                <p>Hosts with Phi Vices should stay vigilant, as the chances of reigniting with a different classification of Vice are fairly high. The presence of a Phi Vice confirms that the Host has the necessary conditions to harbor Vices. Fifty percent of Hosts with Phi Vices have another advent that results in a new classification of Vice within the next three years. Fifteen percent reignite with another Phi Vice, raising their 50% chance of reignition to 75%.</p>
                <p>While rescission may be achieved early, we still recommend seeing a Vice Management Administrator for followups to monitor for possible reignition.</p>
                <h4>Rescinding Phi Vices</h4>
                <p>Many Phi Vices are rescinded at advent due to their smaller, more fragile micro- and meso-exhibitions. Their exhibitions tend to mimic non-prey animals such as goats, deer or even rabbits, though their structure is brittle and gives way easily, even without the use of a patch. Many Phi Vices have such a low level of energy at advent, that they are unable to retreat after their core has been damaged, often creating the opportunity for a fairly straightforward rescission. Even though not much effort is needed for rescission, we still recommend visiting CVRS to stay under a Vice Management Administrator’s supervision due to this Vice’s high rate of reignition.</p>

                    <h3 id="omega">Omega</h3>
                    <span class="label">Critical</span>
                </div>
                <p>This extremely rare classification is often applied post-dispersion, as the properties of Omega Vices tend to shift in ways that other classifications do not, often resulting in lethal misclassifications. The Omega classification is reserved for Vices that cannot be categorized by any of the classifications outlined above, essentially acting as a fringe category of Vices. While rescission is encouraged with all other classifications, Hosts with Omega Vices typically do not have enough information to complete one successfully. Hosts are generally advised to not engage unless absolutely necessary, or a strong team of adjuncts and CVRS agents are available.</p>
                <p>Omega Vices most commonly resemble Epsilon Vices in their ability to plan and deceive, though even experienced Vice Management Administrators and Solutions Architects have difficulty deciphering an Omega Vice’s Branch Ops. Exhibitions tend to be fairly consistent, but are often unbearably massive compared to most exhibitions and tend to evolve and grow at rates not observed in other Vices, sometimes even exceeding the limits of giga-exhibitions. Omega Vices have been known to scrap and rework exhibitions on a whim, even within the Branch Domain. Branch Domains range from being incredibly simple to maze-like and vividly complex, with some Omega Vices being able to change the Branch Domain during production.</p>
                <p>That being said, Omega Vices are much more conservative in initiating Branches and seem to observe and wait for opportune times, rather than act on external stimuli or impulse. While it is possible to agitate or threaten an Epsilon Vice, Omega Vices do not typically respond to threats. “Uncertainty” seems to be the unifying theme of Omega Vices, making this classification the most difficult Vice to treat. --gamma subclasses always accompany Omega classifications.</p>
                <h4>Rescinding Omega Vices</h4>
                <p>We recommend establishing a CVRS care team as soon as you suspect your Vice may be acting out of the ordinary. Your Vice Management Administrator will likely have a robust team of agents to create the most comprehensive and holistic approach to treatment.</p>

                <h2 id="subclasses">Subclasses</h2>
                <p>In certain cases, further classification may be applied to provide a more complete understanding of a Host’s Vice, called subclasses. Subclasses differ from primary classes in that they are unique behaviors or characteristics that can span across multiple classes. They are a fairly new facet of Vice research, conducted primarily by Behavioral Analysts. Subclasses are denoted with a leading double-hyphen and are always lowercase (Epsilon--gamma) and do not impact threat levels. Subclasses can also be stacked, for example: Epsilon--gamma--sigma.</p>
                <h3 id="gamma">--gamma</h3>
                <p>A relatively rare subclass that is often applied post-dispersion, as Vices with this subclass seem to exhibit sentience and are, therefore, nearly impossible to rescind without the proper resources. Vices with this subclass have been known to observe and document its Host's behaviors, even going so far as hearing and recording thoughts. Many --gamma Vices are known to communicate verbally, though this has only been documented within the Branch Domain. Only Vices with a high or critical threat level are capable of having the --gamma subclass.</p>
                <p>A Vice that is capable of learning and observing is not automatically classified as a --gamma Vice. This subclass is reserved for Vices that seem to make informed and calculated decisions outside of those driven by instinct or impulse. This typically refers to shifting Branch Ops but can even be applied to the creation of repos or suppressing/obscuring blights. Of course, making this distinction is difficult and often only applied after a psychological screening of the Host and primary Adjuncts. Many Hosts report the constant feeling of being watched, particularly outside of the Branch Domain. Within the Branch Domain, however, the Vice’s abilities are much more visible, seen through bartering, deception, and manipulation of the Host and any Adjuncts. Some experts believe that they are capable of speech outside of the Branch Domain, though it has never been documented.</p>
                <h3 id="omicron">--omicron</h3>
                <p>This subclass is assigned to Vices that are capable of camouflaging their network as well as any VG emitted from blights. While the network and VG emitted from blights can typically be seen with Parsing Goggles, these Vices have evolved to emit a dense, neutralizing particle that engulfs both VN and VG and prevents them from being seen. This, however, comes at the expense of lowering the potency of VG by preventing it from embedding in potential Host bodies, though they can also be turned off prior to a Vice’s attempt at dispersion. Masked VN—vitiumnexa, the primary molecule in tracks—are also less efficient in relaying information and hormones to the core. This method of camouflage is often implemented as a way to lure Hosts into a false sense of security, leading them to believe that their Vice is well-managed, under control and not an immediate threat. Though, it should be known that the networks of all other Vices are visible regardless of threat level, and a complete lack of a visible network in an infected Host should immediately raise suspicions.</p>
                <h3 id="sigma">--sigma</h3>
                <p>A subclass assigned to Vices that have wider diet preferences. Where most Vices feed on hormones, --sigma Vices are much more permissive and feed on other bodily substances such as plasma or synovial fluid in addition to hormones. Their palate is much less particular, and they can shift their primary energy source depending on availability. They are much more adaptable and resilient in times of scarcity, where other Vices may need to sacrifice growth. Vices with this classification typically have a gradual advent, are more likely to reach maturity, and are known for more complex and flexible Branch Ops. --sigma cores are often larger than other cores, though they do tend to be less structurally sound and are more susceptible to damage from AV. Despite their permissive palate, Vices biologically benefit best from the consumption of hormones, so if a --sigma Vice doesn’t keep a varied diet, its form can be compromised. The --sigma subclass often accompanies the Zeta classification.</p>
                <h3 id="rho">--rho</h3>
                <p>While most Vices have a single, stationary core, --rho Vices have multiple, smaller cores throughout the Host’s body connected by an extremely dense network that often presents as stiff joints. This subclass typically accompanies Vices of a higher threat level and are often stacked with the --gamma subclass. --rho Vices start out with a single core that houses and processes information, then create more cores over time in a process not dissimilar to the creation of repos. The cores created post-advent act like repos until the main core is threatened, when the bulk of the information is transferred to a different core via the network. All Vice cores will need to be destroyed in order for the Vice to be properly rescinded.</p>
