                            <dd>The birth of a Vice—categorized as either sudden or gradual—that officially classifies a Host as infected. Sudden advents occur when the Vice's birth is directly tied to a specific event, and the manifestation of a detectable Vice core immediately follows. Gradual advents occur when the Vice core slowly manifests over time, and no singular event is tied to its creation.

                            <dd>The human body's natural defense against VG, its perfect counter-molecule; when an AV collides with a VG, a small burst of energy is released and both molecules are destroyed. AV can be naturally observed in patches summoned outside of the Branch Arena. While AV are produced by the body naturally, it is often in small amounts and only activated after sudden, drastic changes in VG levels. Artificial AV sources, such as an AVShot or <a href="./cvrs.html#gloves">Summoning Gloves</a>, can help boost the body's natural production. Because VN are considered relatively similar in composition to VG, AV are also capable of attacking and nullifying VN.

                            <dd>A device that floods a Host's body with AV to combat an advancing Vice, similar in appearance to an epinephrine auto-injector. The AV attacks both the Vice network and the core, as direct contact with AV can gradually eat away at the outer shell of the core. AVShots pose the risk of instigating a Branch, and in the case of mature or intelligent Vices, simply agitate the core and can actually increase growth. Use with caution. AVShots are typically used by CVRS agents to facilitate suspension when necessary. Learn more in <a href="./bodies.html#support">Treatments and Support</a>.</dd>

A berserk Host is often unpredictable, and can even be aggressive and hostile, as their body is frantically trying to defend against the advancing Vice. If a Host becomes berserk while a Branch is active, they will remain stationary in their trance—as Hosts are disconnected from their bodies during this time—though minor symptoms have been reported. If a Host becomes berserk outside of the Branch Arena, the advancing Vice can be addressed either with the use of an AVShot or by instigating and committing a Branch. If a berserk Host is left unaddressed, they will become comatose. Learn more in <a href="./bodies.html#status">Host Statuses</a>.</dd>

More aggressive blights are indicative of an advancing Vice core and should not be ignored. Blights are split into three categories: expulsion, drape, and extrusion.

                            <dd>The dissociative side effect of a Vice attempting germination, due to the overwhelming influx of VG emitted from the Vice core. The term “Branch” encompasses all three stages (initiation, staging and production) and presents the Host with three options: suspending, committing or rescinding the Branch. During production, a Host temporarily loses contact with their body, and their consciousness is transported to the Branch Arena, a metaphysical—but finite and limited—environment where the Vice’s exhibition can be fought. This out-of-body experience is often described as a hallucination or dream, though actions taken in the Branch Arena can have very real consequences. If the Branch remains unaddressed or continues for too long, the Vice will begin expanding its core along the established network, resulting in a berserk Host.

                            <dd>The liminal space in which the production stage of a Branch occurs. The arena is comprised of a fabricated environment, the Vice’s exhibition, and extensions of the Host and Adjuncts, as well as their patches. The Branch Arena originates from the Vice core, making the core the true center and the lone corporeal object of the Branch Arena. This environment stays largely the same through a Vice’s life cycle, as its properties draw from those experienced during advent. Over time, this environment can grow to be more complex as the Vice has more energy to devote during staging, though it mostly keeps its core components.

A Vice’s Branch Ops stay largely the same throughout its life cycle, and familiarizing yourself with these properties can help lead to a more efficient rescission. Certain <a href="./classes.html">classifications</a> of Vices—namely Delta and Epsilon Vices—intentionally change their Branch Ops.

                            <dd>The label applied to a Host after the Vice core has been destroyed by a successful rescission. Cleared Hosts can have lingering blights and traces of the previous network, though neither of these pose considerable threats to the Host. They often dissipate gradually over time, but can be expedited with the help of Suppressants or a monthly AVShot. A cleared Host has the potential for reignition, and the new Vice core is considered a biologically different entity from the one that was previously rescinded. Research may suggest that cleared Hosts have a slightly stronger immune system and consequently require a higher concentration of VG to result in another advent.

                            <dd>A Host phase where the Vice core has begun fusing its expanded core with the Host's physical body due to the lack or failure of action during the berserk phase; in this phase, motor control is inhibited and the Vice has flooded the system with lethal amounts of serotonin. High fever, seizures, and heart arrhythmia are indicative of a comatose Host. The Vice core is stretched extremely thin during this process and is incredibly vulnerable to attacks from patches, though attacks do pose a considerable risk to the physical body of the Host due to their fusion. A comatose Host is unresponsive to the physical world, and any attempts at rescission need to be made swiftly, as Hosts do not last long in this phase. Though rescission does pose potential harm to the Host’s physical form, the benefits of a successful rescission far outweigh the finality of dispersion.

                            <dd>One of three potential paths to take during Branches, committing a Branch entails damaging the Vice’s core during production, typically by using a patch. This is the most common action taken during a Branch and is what is recommended if rescission is not attainable. A Branch is a costly maneuver, and when committed, forces the Vice to retract any fresh growth achieved during germination. Committing a Branch buys more time between Branches compared to suspension, and often provides the Host or any present Adjuncts with more information to perform a successful rescission.

Not to be confused with its exhibition, Vice cores typically reside inside the Host’s physical body much like a tumor or parasite and are created when a high concentration of VG are embedded in soft tissue or a benign mass. Cores do not ambulate, but they are able to grow at alarming rates if the conditions are favorable. Learn more about its composition in <a href="./bio.html">Vice Biology</a>.</dd>

                          <dd>The act of expelling an Adjunct from the Branch Arena, banning them from the Branch. Dismissed Adjuncts are capable of forcing re-entry using a <a href="./cvrs.html#backdoor">Backdoor</a>, but the chances of a successful entry are much lower. Dismissal is typically only observed in mature Vices with a higher threat level, as it is a rather costly maneuver that often sacrifices growth and is only performed if the Vice views the Adjunct as a deadly threat. Primary, secondary, and tertiary Adjuncts can all be dismissed, though the dismissal of primary Adjuncts is highly unlikely. Tertiary Adjuncts are easily expelled without sacrificing much growth, if any, and secondary Adjuncts typically take a bit more effort due to their physical contact. Hosts cannot be dismissed from the Branch. Learn more about Adjuncts in <a href="./branch.html#adjuncts">The Role of Adjuncts</a>.</dd>

If a comatose Host is left unaddressed, they will be dispersed. Learn more about dispersion in <a href="./bio.html#reproduction">Vice Reproduction</a>.</dd>

Exhibitions typically take the form of predatory animals—though the possibilities are endless—and are used as a means to inflict fear and distraction as the core grows within the Host. Some exhibitions are comprised of the properties present at advent, typically textures, smells or sounds and can even draw from the innate fears of the Host. Exhibitions also influence blights, as many properties present in the exhibition are mirrored as blights, most commonly seen as horns, teeth or skin textures. Exhibitions are incredibly unique and vary greatly between Hosts, though experts have begun grouping them by size and Branch strategy.

However, within the Branch Arena, extensions are capable of physics-defying feats, much like the logic that allows people to fly or breathe under water in dreams. Injuries sustained within the Branch Arena—such as lacerations or broken bones—manifest afterward as muscle aches and stiffness. Extensions can directly impact the outcome of a Branch through either committing or rescinding the Branch.

                            <dd>Refers to both the process of a Vice expanding its network and growing the core along more established tracks; this most commonly occurs during Branches, with the ultimate goal of dispersion. Vices initiate Branches as a way to distract the Host from the process of germination, as the Host's body tends to mount a violent inflammatory response in reaction to this advancement. Vices also tend to receive an increase in energy, as the Host’s body is flooded with hormones such as adrenaline during this process, creating an almost exponential growth that can quickly result in a berserk Host if the Branch is not promptly addressed. Otherwise, germination is performed at an incredibly minute scale so as to avoid detection. Learn more about this process in <a href="./bio.html">Vice Biology</a>.</dd>

The relationship between a Host and their Vice is evident from this terminology, and is often regarded as parasitic. Everyone possesses the ability to become a Host, but the probability fluctuates based on environment, personal characteristics, and past Vice-related encounters.

The network monitors physiological changes and collects various hormones or other energy sources to send back to the core where it feeds. During Branches, the core grows and expands along this safe, nutrient-rich path. Particularly established networks tend to be rigid and result in achy joints, even going so far as to restrict range of motion in extreme cases. While the network is predominantly internal, in the case of mature Vices, it can extend beyond the Host’s body to create a repo as an external energy reserve. Networks are visible with the use of <a href="./cvrs.html#goggles">Parsing Goggles</a> and are typically only visible in adolescent and older Vices.

                            <dd>A dense collection of AV, understood to be the physical manifestation of a Host’s body attempting to protect it; not all Hosts obtain patches and they cannot be intentionally created. Research posits that patches are only created when the Host is in danger of a particularly threatening potential Branch, typically marked by sudden changes in the physiology of the Vice core, such as resource hoarding or exponential network expansion. Patches range in appearance and function and often resemble weapons or defenses, crafted especially to counter the Vice’s exhibition.

                            <dd>Typically observed in Vices with a higher threat level, repos are external resource hoards where a Vice stores extra energy gathered from a Host, typically during times of excess. It is connected to the Vice core through a densely-packed collection of external tracks, sometimes visible to the naked eye. A Vice can disconnect from its repo at any time, most commonly observed when a Host strays too far from the repo and puts too much of a strain on the tracks. Vices discourage its Host from straying too far by drastically increasing the repo’s energy consumption the closer a Host gets to reaching the limit of the established tracks. Because of this, many Hosts with repos report symptoms such as depression, fatigue, executive dysfunction, and muscle or joint stiffness. Detached repos are capable of surviving separate from their Host for a few weeks, depending on their size, and gradually disintegrate over time, expelling a steady flow of VG. A detached repo is able to reattach if the Host is back in proximity for an established length of time, typically around a week. Learn more in <a href="./bio.html#repo">Establishing Repos</a>.</dd>

                            <dd>The act of destroying a Vice’s core, either manually or with the use of a patch. Rescission is most commonly achieved during a Branch, but fringe cases have reported the manual destruction of a Vice core through extreme measures, such as self mutilation or surgical intervention. Upon achieving successful rescission, a Host is labeled as cleared, with a low possibility of reignition. Lingering blights are not uncommon, and can be dealt with the help of Suppressants or monthly AVShots. Learn more about the act of rescission in <a href="./branch.html">The Branch Phenomenon</a>.

                            <dd>A prescription drug that suppresses the effect of blights by increasing the body’s creation of AV and blocking the primary source of blights, typically an overabundance of histamines. While many Hosts do report relief, Vice Management Specialists prefer to address the root of the problem with Branch management. Suppressants are also understood to dampen symptoms and mask the true status of the Host. Some Hosts have even unknowingly become berserk while on suppressants, with their symptoms presenting more like mania without the added context of agitated blights. Use with caution.

                            <dd>One of three potential paths to take during Branches, suspending a Branch entails threatening the Vice core while the Branch is being staged, by using either an AVShot or patch. This is typically ill-advised, as doing so often agitates the Vice and results in more frequent Branches, among many other downsides. Suspension should only be performed as a last result, particularly to buy more time to prepare. Learn more in <a href="./branch.html#options">Branch Options</a>.</dd>

                          <dd>A tendril-like appendage of the Vice’s network, densely packed with vitiumnexa (VN). Tracks begin growing after the Vice’s core is established in the larval stage. While the primary purpose of tracks is to monitor surroundings and send nutrients back to the core, it is also the path that the core expands along during a Branch. Tracks are generally pliable when newly established, but become more rigid over time, often leading to stiff joints and reduced range of motion. Tracks cannot be seen with the naked eye, but are visible with the use of <a href="./cvrs.html#goggles">Parsing Goggles</a>.

The scan itself simply entails the Record Administrator slowly running a <a href="./cvrs.html#vgmeter">VGMeter</a> over the Host's body. If the screen reads 5 or higher for a particular spot, a dense concentration of VG has been detected and the Host is labeled as infected. If more concrete confirmation is desired, a VGMS may be administered. Learn more about the screening process in <a href="./cvrs.html#care">Establishing Care with a CVRS Team</a>.</dd>

VGMS can also show parts of the network, which typically present as faint, pulsing tunnels extending from the Vice core. VGMS track the growth of the Vice core and inform the Vice Management Specialist if rescission is needed.

                          <dd>VN are the electrically-charged, chemical-laden molecules that make up tracks in the Vice’s network. These molecules are difficult to study, as we are unable to make direct contact with them. Even in high concentrations, our hands and physical instruments faze through them; though they can be observed and documented using <a href="./cvrs.html#goggles">Parsing Goggles</a>, likely due to their composition being similar to VG. It is believed that the genetic material of VG observed with Parsing Goggles are also present in VN, though these molecules serve a much different purpose. These electrically-charged molecules relay rudimentary environmental information back to the core, while also receiving core feedback to expand in times of excess or retract in times of scarcity.
