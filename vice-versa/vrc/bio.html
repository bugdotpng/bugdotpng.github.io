                <p>Vices can live anywhere from a few hours to over 30 years, depending on the hostility of the Host’s immune system, its classification, and the availability of resources. During their life cycle, they feed on a wide variety of hormones produced by our bodies, such as norepinephrine and cortisol. With the help of spore-like molecules called vitiumglomerora (VG), they temporarily stun Hosts while they expand their core, resulting in the metaphysical phenomenon known as a Branch, which can be further explored in <a href="./branch.html">The Branch Phenomenon</a>. Vices are categorized into classifications that outline expected behaviors and can help guide treatment. Learn about these in <a href="./classes.html">Classifying Vices</a>.</p>
                <p>The only corporeal part of a Vice is its core. Its exact biological composition is unknown, as any attempts to surgically dissect these fleshy masses have resulted in the death of the Vice&mdash;if separated from the Host&mdash;or encouraged fusion&mdash;if still embedded in the Host. Though, we do know that it mimics cancerous tumors in composition&mdash;most closely resembling teratomas&mdash;due to the circumstances surrounding its inception. All Vices begin as a benign mass, typically found in fatty tissue or embedded in muscle fibers. Free-floating VG from nearby dispersions, repos, or repeated exposure to Branches collect in the body and colonize these benign masses, ultimately altering the genetic structure of its cells and resulting in the birth of the Vice core. This reproductive process is further outlined below in <a href="#reproduction">Vice Reproduction</a>.</p>
                <p>Hormone levels in the Host's body need to reach and maintain a certain threshold in order for the Vice to survive and establish itself in its nascency. The amount of VG needed to result in a Vice core can be anywhere from a couple hundred to a few thousands, depending on the Host’s biological conditions, particularly their immune system. Many people currently have a small collection of spores in their body, though they do not pose threats in small amounts, short of leading to allergy-like symptoms like rhinitis if the person is particularly sensitive to VG. Some strong immune systems are capable of deploying enough resources to destroy budding Vice cores by relentlessly bombarding the various concentrations of VG with antivitiumglomerora (AV), a natural secretion that destroys VG on contact. Read more about AV in <a href="./bodies.html#patches">AV and Patches</a>.</p>
                <p>After the proper conditions are met, a Vice core will be born in one of two ways: a sudden advent or gradual advent. Sudden advents occur when the body is flooded with an influx of hormones, typically in the case of a stressful or traumatic event, fueling the exponential reproduction of these “error” cells that completely colonize the mass and become the Vice core. In the case of a gradual advent, there is no rush of hormones, but rather a steady stream of elevated levels over an extended period of time. Because of this, it is difficult to say when the mass becomes a Vice core, but the Host is considered infected once the core is detected during a VGDS. Sudden advents are much more common and provide relatively straightforward information that will help with addressing later Branches, while gradual advents tend to be more complex with muddier details.</p>
                <p>All sudden advents result in the Host’s first Branch, though due to the Vice’s immaturity, this initial Branch is fairly simple and straightforward with a fragile exhibition and simple Branch Arena. Some Vices may even prematurely terminate the Branch and retreat from their lack of energy. The properties observed during all phases of this initial Branch give valuable insight into preparing for future Branches, known as the Branch Ops, as these properties tend to remain the same over time, except for certain classifications.</p>
                <p>Because there is no Branch initiated at a gradual advent, it makes it more more difficult to prepare for future Branches. Vices with gradual advents are often more complex than those with a sudden advent, due in large part to the variety of events experienced as the Vice is being conceived. This leads to larger exhibitions, more complex Branch Arenas, and vague triggers. Vices with a gradual advent are typically indicated by increased and uncharacteristic fatigue and are often accidentally detected via ultrasound or other medical imaging. Gradual advents typically birth Vices with higher threat levels.</p>
                <h2>The Life Cycle of Vices</h2>
                <p>Vices typically progress through three stages after advent: larval, adolescent, and mature. Vices progress through these stages and reach maturity by feeding on hormones from its Host, preferring those present at advent. Not all Vices reach maturity, and while maturity is not necessarily indicative of threat level, more mature Vices tend to be more calculated and dangerous. For example, an adolescent Epsilon Vice is typically more threatening than a mature Alpha Vice. Dispersion can be pursued at any stage, but is most commonly performed to completion in mature Vices, while adolescent Vices tend to make the most attempts.</p>

                        <h3>Nascent</h3>
                        <p>Vices begin as a collection of VG obtained from nearby Branches, detached repos, and dispersions that are embedded in benign masses in a potential Host’s body. This embedding process results in “error” cells that slowly grow in number as the potential Host is exposed to more VG over time. This benign mass—often no larger than 6mm—is often embedded in fatty tissue and muscle fibers, but have also been observed adhering to tendons and bone. This benign mass can lay dormant until a sudden influx in hormones triggers its birth (sudden advent), or the steady rise in hormone levels over time nudges it to life (gradual advent). At advent, the genetic makeup of the mass is altered and becomes the Vice core, marking the birth of the Vice.</p>

                    <div class="timeline__stop">
                        <span class="superhead">Stage 1</span>
                        <h3>Larval</h3>
                        <p>After a Vice’s advent, it is officially in the larval stage. These young Vices spend the majority of their time storing energy and learning the ebbs and flows of hormones, responding accordingly. Branches at this stage are unlikely, as energy is typically focused on establishing its core. Excess energy obtained is stored for the use of future Branches. Larval cores are relatively small, typically between 10 and 20mm, though they tend to be extremely dense from hoarded resources and display prominently as a solid white mass on a VGMS. Larval Vices do not have an established network, and any tracks are not yet visible on a VGMS.</p>
                        <p>In this stage, some Hosts report cases of extreme fatigue or disorientation due to a Vice’s excessive feeding and seek rescission guided by a Vice Management Specialist. This excessive feeding is primarily observed in Zeta Vices, though all Vices are capable of feeding at this degree of intensity. What sets Zeta Vices apart is that this excessive feeding is not acute, lasting anywhere from a month to half a year, which often drives Hosts to pursue rescission.</p>
                        <p>Please note that rescission at any stage poses risks, even at the larval stage. The properties of larval Vices have not been determined and cannot be prepared for, though the probability of an advanced exhibition and complex Branches are unlikely.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="timeline__stop">
                        <span class="superhead">Stage 2</span>
                        <h3>Adolescent</h3>
                        <p>After a Vice has established its core and familiarized itself with its environment, it will move into the adolescent stage where it will begin prompting the Host into Branches in an attempt to expand its network and grow its core, known as germination. During this stage, a Vice core can range anywhere from 15mm to 30mm, depending on varying factors such as access to resources. Outside of Branches, Vices will continue to prioritize growth, expanding its core at a near-imperceptible pace so as to not trip the Host’s immune system.</p>
                        <p>In this stage, tracks in the network are also assigned specific duties, with thinner tracks monitoring environmental changes and thicker tracks transporting hormones for feeding. Some tracks are even embedded into organs like lymph nodes, pituitary glands, and even parts of the brain, or are extended outside the body to monitor a wealth of environmental properties, like temperature, sound, or even relative humidity.</p>
                        <p>Now that the Vice is familiar with the Host’s hormone fluctuations, patterns will begin to emerge in Branch initiation, often tying in to stressful events with properties that mirror those found at advent. The Vice’s newly established network plays an essential role in detecting changes in its environment that instruct the Vice when to best and most effectively initiate Branches.</p>
                        <p>Each Branch requires massive amounts of energy to fuel both germination and the creation of the Branch Arena, so repeated Branches in quick succession are unlikely. Adolescent Vices are learning how to balance between feeding, growth, and initiating Branches, and they begin observing and documenting their Host’s behavior using their newly established network.</p>
                        <p>Though, despite all the new resources at their disposal, adolescent Vices are still impulsive and inexperienced. In this stage, they are likely to initiate rogue Branches that deviate from their established Branch Ops, either as a defense mechanism or as an attempt to intentionally throw off the Host. A successful rescission is fairly likely in this stage thanks to the Vice’s inexperience, though the longer a Vice spends in the adolescent stage, the more experienced and consequently dangerous it becomes. If a Vice is particularly aggressive or deceptive, it is highly encouraged to instigate a Branch and pursue rescission with a support team before it matures further.</p>

                        <span class="superhead">Stage 3</span>
                        <h3>Mature</h3>
                        <p>Vice maturity is fairly difficult to nail down, as no discernible changes in core makeup are apparent between these phases. Mature Vice cores vary greatly in size, ranging anywhere from 20mm to 60mm, in extreme cases. Rather than looking at composition, mature Vices are most notably identified by their restraint; that is, showing that it has learned to observe and wait for the opportune time to initiate Branches, rather than initiating Branches every time the environment appears to be suitable. A mature Vice’s network is also well-established and can be seen as white tunnels on a VGMS. Mature Vices tend to exacerbate blights more than other stages, though this alone does not indicate maturity.</p>
                        <p>Mature Vices have mastered the art of feeding and balancing Branches, optimizing their energy consumption. They do not prioritize feeding or growth, but rather they focus on utilizing the information gathered to take advantage of the Host’s vulnerabilities. Quality over quantity is the name of the game with mature Vices. They are much more calculated than adolescent Vices, and while Branches are less common, they’re much more dangerous. Repos are typically only established by mature Vices, as they require a level of awareness and foresight not typically observed in adolescent Vices. Rescission in this stage is not guaranteed and will likely require a team of dedicated Adjuncts, no matter the Vice’s classification.</p>
                        <p>Many Vices do not reach true maturity or are simply incapable of doing so due to their unique characteristics, such as with Phi and Delta Vices.</p>
                    </div>
                </div>
                <h2 id="defense">Reactivity and Defense Mechanisms</h2>
                <p>Vice cores must have a relatively steady flow of hormones and a stable environmental temperature of anywhere between 98 and 100 degrees fahrenheit. Because this is not always guaranteed, Vices focus on energy consumption and storage during the larval stage, reserving hoards of hormones for times of scarcity and uncertainty. Many young Vices also redirect their energy reserves to focus on building a thick, blubbery outer layer around the core that acts as a layer of insulation for times of widely varying environmental temperature, usually in the case of a Host’s illness.</p>
                <p>During its adolescent phase, Vices obtain information from stimuli through the tracks that extend from its core, known collectively as its network. Tracks are not literal extensions of the core, rather, these tendril-like appendages are dense collections of vitiumnexi (VN), electrically-charged molecules that sense changes in the environment and send rudimentary information back to the core for processing. These tracks are also able to send encountered hormones back to the core to feed, though this has only been observed in more established tracks. A network is essentially how a Vice is able to "see" the world around their Host and learn their behaviors in order to brace for any impending threats.</p>
                <p>While Vices tend to follow patterns when initiating Branches, in rare instances, they can deviate from their expected behavior and initiate Branches in reaction to a perceived threat, known as a rogue Branch. Rogue Branches are often used to distract a Host and catch them off guard if a Vice feels that it is losing a clear view of the Host's status, often the result of unexpected biofeedback, a sudden drop in hormones, or even an influx of AV from an AVShot. Learn more about rogue Branches in <a href="./branch.html#fringe">Fringe Branch Events</a>.</p>
                <p>If a Vice core is threatened outside of the Branch Arena, particularly by manual intervention, the core is likely to fuse with the Host’s body, creating a rigid structure that sacrifices growth, but withstands external stressors. Fused cores are unable to continue growing, though over a considerable amount of time, their rigid structure begins to soften, and mobility is reacquired. Many Vices will also choose to fuse specific parts of the core, in what many see as a warning, wherein the Vice will complete fusion if the stressors persist. The act of fusion, especially when performed on or near vital organs, can be lethal, as the fused viscera loses its anatomical function, essentially becoming dead tissue. While the fused core itself does not spread, the damage can leech out into and kill surrounding tissue, often resulting in the need for amputations or organ transplants.</p>
                <p>A fused core, even partially fused cores, cannot initiate dispersion, which requires the Vice core to stretch itself throughout the Host’s body. For this reason, fusion is only executed when the Vice is under extreme duress as a last-ditch effort to avoid rescission. Vice cores only initiate fusion when they are externally threatened, and standard Branch events are not at risk of triggering fusion. However, suspension can run the risk of prompting fusion, particularly when piercing or slashing patches are used. The risks of suspension are further outlined in Branch Options.</p>
                <h2 id="feeding">Feeding and Energy Processing</h2>
                <p>Vices primarily feed off of hormones excreted by the Host and tend to prefer those present in high amounts during advent. Vices use these hormones for a wide variety of processes, most commonly contributing to the growth of its core. As the core matures, it begins redirecting its energy reserves toward expanding its network and establishing its Branch Ops.</p>
                <p>Vices use their network to gather hormones throughout the body and send them back to the core. In its nascency, cores are passive feeders that consume hormones that happen to pass by, but as it grows, it begins to send out these tracks to seek out hormones, sometimes even going so far as to embed these tracks in the glands or organs secreting the hormones.</p>
                <p>The <a href="./classes.html#sigma">--sigma</a> subclass is capable of feeding on any and all hormones, even extending its palate to other bodily secretions, such as plasma and interstitial fluid. Because of this, these Vices tend to grow exponentially in their larval stage and can quickly grow out of control. Learn more in <a href="./classes.html">Vice Classifications</a>.</p>
                <h3 id="repo">Establishing Repos</h3>
                <!-- <figure class="captioned-media captioned-media--small-right">
                    <img src="../images/repo.jpg" alt="A photoshoped image of a repo, a nondescript pile of black sludge in an alleyway. The image has JPG artifacts and glitching around the photoshopped area.">
                    <figcaption class="caption">A repo found in an alleyway, submitted anonymously. Repos are notoriously hard to photograph, as the VG being emanated often corrupt or distort imagery.</figcaption>
                </figure> -->
                <p>In rare and extreme cases, some Vices recognize they have “outgrown” their Host or can get away with feeding in excess, but they don’t want to set off the Host’s immune system by taking advantage of the excess and engaging in detectable growth. The circumstances that result in a repo are simultaneously calculated and hinging on luck, and for this reason, repos tend to be quite rare.</p>
                <p>The core extends light, external tracks to seek out suitable masses to infect, most often freshly deceased vermin such as rats and squirrels that are unlikely to be disturbed in low-traffic areas. Once a mass is identified, the Vice implants these light tracks in the mass to act like a beacon and alert the Vice if the Host frequents the area. After it determines the mass is in an area frequented by the Host, it prioritizes external tracks where it redirects excessive VG to be embedded in the mass, ultimately creating a repo. The end product is not a direct extension of the core, but rather a separate storage area where a Vice can both take and deposit resources using its network.</p>
                <p>Over time, and as more resources are deposited, this infected mass begins to resemble its core, becoming a pile of dark, pulsing flesh that emanates the smells present at advent. Long-standing repos have been known to develop simple eye-like growths that help monitor the goings-on around them. While these growths do not literally “see” they do help monitor environmental fluctuations and can sense movement or changes in light and temperature. Bone, teeth, and nails from the original carcass are likely to shift within the repo as it grows and are sometimes visible in its thick outer skin.</p>
                <p>Repos are not ambulatory, though larger masses tend to pulsate as they internally redirect their energy reserves. Repos are not sentient like the Vice’s core, and information is not stored in repos. It is simply an external energy storage unit.</p>
                <p>When the conditions are right, Vices create repos with the intent to utilize the stored energy to fuel explosive core growth during a Branch. When the Vice initiates a Branch near an established repo, the Vice core will “suck” the contents of the repo into the Host’s compromised body using its network. The viscera is most commonly fazed through pores in the Host’s skin near the Vice core, though it can sometimes enter the Host’s system through other orifices, such as the mouth, nose, or ears if that is the most direct route. This transportation can be interrupted by those outside of the Branch by summoning a patch and destroying the contents or the repo itself.</p>
                <p>Most Vices that do deign to establish a repo, do so multiple times throughout their life cycle, with more mature Vices being able to manage multiple repos at once. All repos must maintain connection to the core through its network, and any disruptions in connection can trigger the repo to begin disintegrating. While the tracks that tie a repo to its core are not rigid in a literal sense, the further a Host strays from an established repo, the more strain this network has on a Host's body, often observed in complaints of exhaustion, inexplicable body aches, and lack of motivation. If the Host strays too far from the repo, the external tracks will detach, rendering the repo temporarily unusable. If the Host returns to frequenting the area where the repo was established—and not too much of it has disintegrated—the Vice can reattach the repo to its core using its network.</p>
                <p>When a repo detaches from its core or if a repo is destroyed, a burst of VG is released, the frayed tracks and disintegrating repo spewing VG into the environment. Because there is no longer a drain on their system, Hosts often feel a sudden, inexplicable increase in energy. The increased level of VG in the surrounding environment tends to agitate or excite Vices nearby, often spawning rogue Branches. While not the intended goal of a repo detachment, the process floods the environment with VG and aids in the reproduction of Vices.</p>
                <h2 id="reproduction">Vice Reproduction</h2>
                <p>All Vices have the ability to reproduce by dispersing spore-like nanoparticles that embed themselves in a potential Host’s soft tissue or muscle fibers. These spores are called vitiumglomeroro (VG, singular: vitiumglomerorum) and are comprised of the genetic material that births new Vice cores when enough are congealed together in the Host’s body to withstand the attacks from their immune system. These spores, when embedded in small amounts, attempt to take root but are quickly disposed of by the Host’s immune system. But in larger amounts, they are able to colonize enough of a benign mass to form a thick outer skin that repels these attacks and allows the inner core to begin forming.</p>
                <p>Once the core has been established, it can work on producing VG to be distributed in various ways, most commonly seen in the act of dispersion, though VG have also been observed hanging around blights and flooding the Host during staging.</p>
                <h3>Dispersion</h3>
                <p>Dispersion is a process expressly reserved for reproduction and therefore has the highest rate of success. Dispersion results from an unaddressed Branch—those that are not suspended, committed or rescinded. This means that the Branch keeps the Host and any Adjuncts trapped in the Branch Arena while the Vice core continues germination. Some Adjuncts are capable of exiting the Branch in this state, though it is extremely difficult to do so, as the longer an Adjunct is kept in an active Branch, the deeper their ties to the Host and the more powerful the trance. As the Host progresses to berserk then comatose, the Vice core continues its expansion throughout the Host’s body and begins fusing with soft tissue, muscles and organs. If the Branch is not committed or rescinded during this precarious phase, the Vice will initiate the act of dispersion.</p>
                <p>Dispersion typically occurs in the blink of an eye in an explosive event that often results in electrical surges or power outages. After the Vice core has fused with more than 40% of the Host’s body, the fused parts liquidate and quickly retract in on itself, bringing the rest of the Host’s body towards the center of the core in a grotesque display of cracking bones and squelching organs. The entirety of the Host’s body is compacted inside the core to create an incredibly dense concentration of matter in a two-inch sphere so dark, it absorbs light and looks completely flat.</p>
                <p>The second that the core initiates this retraction, it dismisses the Adjuncts from the Branch Arena. Adjuncts have at most 3 seconds to distance themselves from the Host, though this is often difficult to do, as the act of dismissal is quite disorienting. The Vice then uses the Host’s body as fuel to disperse hundreds of millions of VG in an explosive, shockwave-like event. Due to their proximity, the bodies of the recently expelled Adjuncts are overwhelmed with the super-charged VG that immediately latch onto and fuse with their organs in incredibly dense collections. The sheer force of dispersion provides these VG with the power to overtake the Adjunct’s body and perform the process of dispersion yet again, sucking the Adjunct’s body into a dense sphere that sends another round of VG out into the ether to infect passersby. This domino effect occurs regardless of the Adjunct’s infection status and drastically increases the reach of VG.</p>
                <p>Those within an immediate radius but not brought in as Adjuncts are the most susceptible to a higher, but not lethal, concentration of VG. Those as far as 10 meters away are still susceptible to contracting noticeable amounts of VG. Dispersion is generally regarded as a traumatic event, and witnessing a dispersion in person often results in the advent of a Vice, due in large part to the elevated hormone levels from stress and the newly-acquired VG from the nearby dispersion. If a Host is already infected, the influx of VG often excites the Vice and results in a rogue Branch.</p>
                <p>All things considered, dispersion is relatively uncommon, only observed in the event of unaddressed Branches or particularly intelligent and mature Vices. Refer to Classifying Vices to see which classifications pose a higher threat of dispersion.</p>
                <h3>Repo Detachment</h3>
                <p>Repo detachment is a fairly uncommon event, though most Vices that manage to create a repo typically deal with repo detachment at least once in its life cycle. Repo detachment occurs when a Host strays too far from the established repo, putting immense strain on the Vice’s rigid network and causing the tracks to snap. This removes the drain of nutrients from the Host, often resulting in an inexplicable burst of energy.</p>
                <p>Immediately, the repo begins disintegrating, emitting a steady stream of VG into the environment. Because the act of repo detachment is a relatively low-energy process, the VG expelled tend to hang around the area, permeating a two-meter radius around the disintegrating repo. Only those that breach the radius are at risk of coming into contact with the VG. These clouds of VG can be neutralized using an AVCharge.</p>
                <h2 id="intelligence">Evolution and Intelligence</h2>
                <p>Though vicology is a relatively new field of study, Vices have grown and evolved during their short time under our observation. In the earliest observed Vices, complex intelligence did not seem to be a present factor, even in more mature Vices. As more Vices facilitate successful dispersions, more unique mixes of VG birth Vices into existence, creating combinations of properties not yet observed and leading to entirely new classifications. Vices will only continue to grow and evolve as time moves on, and as they do, so will we. CVRS is dedicated to following the progression of these Vices and is diligently researching ways to combat these invasive, ever-changing creatures.</p>
                <p>New Vices are tending toward higher threat levels and often tout higher levels of intelligence, leading to a massive increase in recent <a href="./classes.html#gamma">--gamma</a> subclassifications. Even the Alpha Vices of today seem to be much more intentional in their behavior than their predecessors. Arming yourself with knowledge is imperative, regardless of classification. Vices of any class, in any life stage, can act and react in ways that deviate from expectation, as they are fundamentally animals driven by instinct. The more we learn about these creatures, the more complex they seem to become, operating in methods and realms not previously explored.</p>
                <p>As these creatures evolve, we need your cooperation and participation in research trials and observatory studies. Visit your local CVRS to begin your treatment plan today and help further the field of Vice research.</p>
