                <p>As a Vice progresses, our bodies go through various phases that indicate the urgency of the situation and inform treatment plans. While infected with a Vice, our body is constantly fighting back to the best of its ability. As a form of defense, some Hosts summon large concentrations of AV, called a patch, that can be used to defend oneself or protect others. Blights also play a role in signaling a Vice’s intentions and can warn Hosts of an advancing Vice.</p>
                <h2 id="status">Host Statuses</h2>
                <p>Hosts have a variety of statuses that communicate urgency and drive treatment plans. While a Host is infected, they can further be categorized by the degree that the Vice has spread within their body.</p>
                <figure class="captioned-media">
                    <img class="img-border" src="../images/statuses.jpg" alt="a simple chart displaying the progression of host phases">
                </figure>
                <h3>Latent</h3>
                <p>A status referred to primarily in retrospect, when agents are studying or discussing advent properties and the experiences that may influence a Vice’s core. A Host’s physiological and biological status during latency can provide valuable information to CVRS agents and can even aid in classification.</p>
                <h3>Infected</h3>
                <p>Hosts are labeled as infected when a Vice has been successfully detected with a VGDS. After advent, Vice cores can be monitored using regular VGMS, while Vice behaviors and statuses can be observed through blights and Branches. Now that the Vice is detectable, classification can occur based on the information gathered at advent and its behavior between the initial Branches. While a Host is infected, they fall into one of three categories: stable, berserk, or comatose. These sub-phases cannot be measured or tested for and are instead determined by the Vice’s behavior and how the Host’s body is reacting to it.</p>
                <h4>Stable</h4>
                <p>While a Host is infected, they will spend the majority of their time in this phase. Being stable does not imply the Host is asymptomatic; rather, it means that both the Host and the Vice are behaving “in character”. Blights are not agitated, Branch Ops have not deviated, and the Vice core has not grown significantly. A stable Host’s immune system is barely aware the body is infected with a Vice and behaves as such. Some stable Hosts have relatively minor blights that are permanently present, such as sharpened incisors or small, nubby horns. The presence of these permanent blights varies between Hosts and is not a cause for concern.</p>
                <h4>Berserk</h4>
                <p>A Host often steps into this phase during Branches, when the Vice core takes advantage of the Host’s compromised immune system and begins growing exponentially. As the core expands, the body is overrun with VG, prompting the Branch and agitating blights. Even if a Host is in an active Branch, their body is still fighting back against the Vice, increasing the output of AV to defend against the advancing Vice. The Host’s body, however, is also flooding their system with hormones like adrenaline and cortisol, which ultimately help fuel the Vice’s growth. With the extra energy, the Vice is able to outpace the AV and continue expansion.</p>
                <p>Blights are often extremely agitated in this phase, in addition to extreme mood fluctuations, often seen as unpredictability, impulsivity, and hostility. Increased heart rate, drastic changes in body temperature, sweating, coughing, emesis, seizures, and even mania are all symptoms of a berserk Host. If a Host is berserk during an active Branch, their muscles are taut and their jaws are clenched, often resulting in small tremors.</p>
                <p>While it is possible to properly commit the Branch and stabilize the Host, pursuing rescission is highly recommended, if possible. If a Vice is successful in making a Host berserk, rogue Branches are likely to follow, especially if the host is infected with an adolescent Vice. If the Branch goes unaddressed, a Host will become comatose as the Vice attempts to complete its fusion.</p>
                <h4>Comatose</h4>
                <p>A Host becomes comatose once the Vice core has begun the process of fusing its recently expanded core with the Host’s body. Fusion is the process of the Vice core infiltrating organs and viscera and intertwining its makeup with these structures. As the contents of the Vice core mix with the viscera, this mixture becomes extremely rigid and solidifies, essentially killing the tissues it has fused with. Learn more about fusion in <a href="./bio.html#defense">Reactivity and Defense Mechanisms</a>.</p>
                <p>During this time, the Host’s body is shutting down, losing motor control, and flooding the Host's system with serotonin, resulting in serotonin syndrome. While the core is fused with the Host’s body, doing so has stretched it extremely thin, making the core vulnerable in both the corporeal and metaphysical realms. Due to this vulnerable state, rescission is still achievable, even if a Host is comatose. If a Host is able to rescind their Vice during this phase, the Host will be cleared but will likely suffer extreme lingering blights and can even develop autoimmune disorders, damaged joints and chronic pain. In extreme cases, amputations or organ transplants may be needed. AVShots may buy the Host time, but are ultimately futile at this phase.</p>
                <p>Within the Branch Arena, Hosts may find it difficult to think clearly and make sound, rational decisions. During this phase, Adjuncts are imperative to success. If a Host is unsuccessful at rescission, the Vice will complete the fusion process and begin the act of dispersion.</p>
                <h3>Cleared</h3>
                <p>A cleared Host is the result of a successful rescission, which is only achieved once the Vice core is destroyed. In more extreme cases, trace amounts of a Vice’s network can still be detectable after rescission and can contribute to lingering blights, though these are not considered “live” fragments of the original Vice core. Cleared Hosts do still run the risk of reignition, though it is uncommon, and many experts believe cleared Host have a higher tolerance to VG, and thus require a higher concentration of it to spark another advent. A Vice Management Specialist or Blight Specialist can help with lingering blights and facilitate post-rescission treatment, if needed.</p>
                <h3>Dispersed</h3>
                <p>This status is applied to Hosts postmortem, as the process of dispersion kills the Host. After the Vice core has made a fused network throughout the Host’s body, it begins absorbing it from the inside out, sucking the remaining viscera into its core. It quickly recedes into a dense ball of flesh, no more than two inches, then explodes in a violent burst that sends a wave of VG in every direction. Adjuncts present at the time of dispersion are also consumed in a domino-like effect where the sheer number of VG overwhelm the them and fuse with their body, prompting another round of dispersion. Learn more about this process in <a href="./bio.html#reproduction">Vice Reproduction</a>.</p>

                <h2 id="blights">What are Blights?</h2>
                <p>Blights are extensions of a Host's body, influenced by a Vice’s exhibition and the properties of its core. All blights are visible to the human eye and can be further monitored by Blight Specialists and Vice Management Specialists. When extracted from a Host, blights are not dissimilar to the organic materials they are mimicking, such as scales or feathers, though they often emanate VG, even after extraction.</p>
                <p>Blights often mimic the Vice’s exhibition. For example, if a Vice's exhibition is covered in scales and exudes electricity, the Host is likely to have a couple patches of scales on their arms or face and lightly shock others when touching. If the Host progresses to a more severe status or the Vice is more mature, the Host might have their entire upper body covered in scales and have uncontrollable bouts of electric pulses.</p>
                <p>There are three categories of blights, each with unique properties.</p>

                            <dd>Expulsion blights originate in, but ultimately leave the body. Expulsion blights typically begin around the Vice core and exit the Host through the mouth, nose, ears, or pores. Most Hosts only have one expulsion blight at a time, if any. When a Host is berserk, expulsion blights tend to be the most reactive. Expulsion blights, particularly those than mimic dangerous or harmful substances, do not harm the Host, but can harm others on contact. Examples of expulsion blights include smoke, static, and acid.</dd>

                            <dd>Drape blights typically lay close to the skin, rarely straying from the Host’s body. Drape blights begin, and often stay, in localized patches across the skin, but in severe cases, they have been known to cover a Host’s entire body. Drape blights are fairly uncommon, though they have a tendency to manifest in groups and overlap with the other. Examples most commonly include fur, scales, and feathers; though, some Hosts have noted unconventional presentation of these features, such as velvety scales or leathery patches lined with fur.</dd>

                                <p>Extrusion blights are unnatural extensions of a Host’s body, typically originating and extruding from existing bone or deep within tissues. Extrusion blights from bone are stationery, while those that originate from tissues are able to be manipulated and articulated. These are the most commonly observed blights and have been known to present in many different ways, Hosts often being inflicted with multiple extrusion blights at a time.</p>
                                <p>The larger and further away from the body an extrusion blight is, the more sensitive or painful the base becomes due to strain. Extrusion blights are often heavy, dense, and uncomfortable, and larger blights often drive Hosts to seek treatment. Examples of smaller extrusion blights are fangs, blunt horns, and claws, while larger, more painful extrusion blights can be tails, long horns, wings, or spikes.</p>
                                <p>Many Vice Management Specialists and Blight Specialists measure the growth of these blights as a quick, non-invasive indicator of the Vice’s progress, as larger, more prominent extrusion blights directly correlate with increased core size.</p>
                                <p>Excessive blights can be treated with Suppressants, often administered by a Vice Management Specialist or Blight Specialist. Though, it is important to keep in mind that the manifestation of blights is a way in which our bodies communicate with us, and excessive blights are often indicative of an underlying issue. Suppressants should only be administered as a means of providing relief. Learn more about Suppressants in <a href="#support">Treatments and Support</a>.</p>

                            <p>Some blights can have lingering effects on a Host's body, even after rescission, known as pseudo-blights. These blights are often the result of more mature Vices that put a strain on the Host’s immune system and have left traces of its network behind. After the Host has been cleared, the immune system and hormone levels can take roughly a month to equalize as it works to address any remaining traces of the Vice. Keeping stress levels low during this time is highly recommended.</p>
                            <p>If desired, a small, short term dose of Suppressants can be prescribed to use on an as-needed basis to offer relief during flare-ups, but does not lessen the time it takes for pseudo-blights to resolve. If the cleared Host continues to have pseudo-blights after completing their first round of Suppressants, an appointment with a Blight Specialist may need to be scheduled for further evaluation.</p>

                <h2 id="patches">AV and Patches</h2>
                <p>As Vices have evolved, so, too, have our bodies. Roughly thirty years ago, in direct response to the growing complexity of Vices, our bodies began releasing a counter-molecule called antivitumglomerorum (AV, plural: antivitiumglomerora). These molecules are the perfect opposite of VG, and direct contact between the two results in the destruction of both particles. Because vitiumnexa (VN, singular: vitiumnexum)—what the tracks in the Vice’s network are comprised of—share a similar composition with VG, AV are also capable of breaking them down, though they do tend to leave behind a negative charge in the process. Because of this, AVShots often have light static shocks as a side effect, similar in intensity to the small zaps one can feel on a dry winter day.</p>
                <p>As the production of AV became a more standard defense mechanism across the population, our bodies began to concentrate these molecules into tangible objects used to defend ourselves against advancing Vices, known as patches.</p>
                <p>A patch is a densely-packed concentration of AV—often in the shape of simple, traditional weapons—that can help Hosts and Adjuncts successfully address Branches. Even when a patch is summoned, AV still exists in the body and can continue to defend against an advancing Vice, though at a lower efficacy. Patches summoned outside of the Branch Arena have a fluid, shifting form that emanates a bright, cool light due to its composition of AV. Within the Branch Arena, patches have a more solid and detailed form with flourishes and details unique to both its weapon class and the Host it belongs to. For example, if two Hosts have patches that imitate swords, one could have a simpler design while the other has engravings and embedded jewels. These differences in design often pull from the Host’s personal experiences, and can even go so far as to mimic actual objects from the Host’s life. A Host can also have multiple patches at once, though they will be the same and often at the expense of overall size. Examples include dual handaxes and collections of throwing stars.</p>
                <p>During staging, a patch can be used to threaten the Vice core or render the Host unconscious without making contact so the Vice is forced to prematurely terminate the Branch. During production, they can deal devastating damage to the Vice core. Learn more below in <a href="#wielding">Wielding a Patch</a>.</p>
                <p>Patches are typically created as a direct reaction to having a Vice, though the circumstances in which they are created vary greatly between Hosts. Some Hosts receive their patches early in their Vice’s life cycle, while others can take years. Even after rescission, patches can still be summoned. If a Host contracts another Vice after rescission, their initial patch is likely to change shape over time to properly defend against the newly contracted Vice. The process outlined below details a Host’s first interaction with their patch.</p>
                <h3>Establishing a Patch</h3>
                <p>Patches are first observed in a Host as a burst of AV and can present in multiple ways, often emitted from the nose, mouth or pores. Many Hosts recall a light tickle in the back of the throat that results in a sparkling cough or sneeze, or a chalky residue on their hands that leaves a trail of shimmering dust.</p>
                <p>Establishing a patch takes time, roughly two to three weeks depending on its intended complexity. While it starts as an amorphous cloud of dust, over the next few weeks, the body learns how to properly concentrate and form the expelled AV and the patch begins to take its shape. The final structure of the patch cannot be chosen and is thought to be determined by the body itself, influencing the shape to best combat the Vice’s exhibition. For example, if a Vice’s exhibition has a defensive outer shell, a large blunt weapon like a hammer or club may be established. While patches are generally considered to be intentionally designed, not all patches end up being helpful in the Branch Arena. In this instance, we recommend enlisting the help of Adjuncts or CVRS agents with the desired patch design.</p>
                <p>Summoning Gloves and other Hosts can help to speed up the process by aiding in the output of AV, though many report that this expedited process can be unbearably painful if forced too quickly. When a patch is ready to be summoned, an inexplicable warmth can be felt in the palms.</p>
                <h3>Summoning a Patch</h3>
                <p>After a patch is properly established, it can be summoned at will through the body’s summoning site, which is often in the palm of the Host’s dominant hand. Summoning sites can be relocated by concentrating on the subtle sensation of heat and slowly migrating it through the body to the desired location. This same mindfulness is also needed to mark and ignite the summoning site, ultimately summoning the patch. This will require practice, and it is encouraged to rehearse the process particularly during slower times so that it will come naturally when the situation is urgent.</p>
                <p>In its early stages, a summoned patch can be wielded as intended, though its efficacy is typically low due to its lower structural density. With time and repeated practice, the structural integrity strengthens and is able to both deliver and receive blows without much compromise.</p>
                <p>Summoning gloves are used by CVRS agents to boost their body’s output of AV and effortlessly summon their patch without much effort.</p>
                <h3 id="wielding">Wielding a Patch</h3>
                <p>Patches can be utilized during staging to suspend a Branch or during production to commit or rescind a Branch. It is important to understand the structural differences between these two options, as these differences will impact how the patch is handled. During staging, the patch has a bright, fluid form due to its composition of AV, but within the Branch Arena, the patch is detailed and solid, closely resembling the weapon it mimics.</p>
                <h4>During Staging</h4>
                <p>Effectively wielding a patch during staging requires immense concentration. Though it can generally retain its shape while being held, once movement is introduced, its form becomes less rigid and can “smear”, spreading its AV across a wider surface area and reducing its efficacy. The same mindfulness needed for summoning should also be applied if wielding a patch during staging. With dedicated practice, it becomes more natural and less concentration is needed. Summoning Gloves can also be used to “stabilize” the fluid composition of patches outside of the Branch Arena by increasing the output of AV and solidifying its form. Patches tend to degrade more quickly outside of the Branch Arena as well, so precision and timeliness are the keys to success.</p>
                <h4>During Production</h4>
                <p>Wielding a patch during production comes much more naturally and requires less concentration, as it is the intended environment for a patch. Minor adjustments to the patch’s form can be made in the Branch Arena, though this is often at the expense of its structural integrity, especially if it has increased complexity. Patches take much less time to degrade in the Branch Arena and can even be set aside to regenerate during production, though doing so would require roughly half an our of in-Branch time to incur visible results. If Summoning Gloves are donned before production, they are present in the Branch Arena and can lend the same support in bolstering one’s patch.</p>
                <h3>Patch Maintenance</h3>
                <p>Within the Branch Arena, and during staging especially, a patch will degrade as it comes in contact with VG. During staging, if a patch makes contact with a Host, the VG that have overwhelmed the body interact with the AV of the patch and neutralize each other. The same concept applies to the Branch Arena as well, where the patch neutralizes the Vice’s exhibition at the point of contact. Typically, patches degrade more quickly in the short minute of staging than they do within a Branch’s entire production, this being another reason why committing will always be recommended over suspension.</p>
                <p>Over time, the body will naturally siphon AV to replenish what was lost. Rest and keeping stress low during this time can help speed up the process. AVShots can also be administered if a patch was severely damaged, but should be done so with caution, as they can agitate the Vice or unintentionally instigate a Branch.</p>
                <h3>Types of Patches</h3>
                <p>Generally speaking, patches are not limited to a set pool of options and have even strayed outside the realm of weapons in niche instances, but they are crafted with the sole intent to counter a Host’s Vice, which typically results in a weapon-like object. Patches are classified into the categories below strictly based on the intent of the object.</p>
                <div class="desc-list">
                  <dl>
                    <div class="description-block">
                      <dt>Piercing</dt>
                      <dd>These patches are manifested with the intent to stab and puncture thick hides or scales. Examples include short knives and daggers, thrown weapons like javelins or spears, long-range weapons like arrows or tridents, or more unconventional weapons like ice picks, needles, or darts.</dd>
                    </div>
                    <div class="description-block">
                      <dt>Slashing</dt>
                      <dd>These patches are manifested with the intent to slash and cut through relatively fleshy, soft exhibitions. They can also be used to sever limbs or carve through excessive fat layers. Examples include weapons with large blades, such as axes and swords, serrated weapons like saws, or unconventional weapons such as bread knives or scalpels. Some weapons used for strangulation are included in this classification, such as piano wire and garrotes.</dd>
                    </div>
                    <div class="description-block">
                      <dt>Bludgeoning</dt>
                      <dd>
                        <p>These patches are manifested with the intent to inflict blunt force trauma on the exhibition by damaging thick, outer shells or compromising skeletal structures. Examples include traditional weapons such as staffs, hammers, and clubs, while more modern examples include baseball bats and brass knuckles. Unconventional examples include lead pipes, golf clubs, and the ever-comical steel chair.</p>
                        <p>While the argument can be made that anything thrown with enough force could be classified as a bludgeoning weapon, what truly classifies a patch is the intent of the object. If bludgeoning is a secondary effect of the patch, such as the stock of a gun or the handle of an axe, it cannot be classified as bludgeoning.</p>
                      </dd>
                    </div>
                    <div class="description-block">
                      <dt>Defensive</dt>
                      <dd>These patches have the express intention of shielding the Host or Adjunct from the exhibition’s attacks. Some consider defensive patches to be subclasses of bludgeoning patches, as they can also be used to inflict blunt damage in close range, though it still goes back to intent, and these patches are manifested to defend. Examples include standard wood or metal shields, but can also extend to improvised shields like trash can lids or sheets of plywood, those these are extremely rare, as defensive patches are already quite uncommon.</dd>
                    </div>
                    <div class="description-block">
                      <dt>Fringe</dt>
                      <dd>
                        <p>A catchall grouping that houses patches that do not fit into any of the above categories. Because of this, patches that belong to this category often do not have any shared characteristics. “Fringe” does not necessarily mean “unconventional” in this instance, as some rare and unique patches can still be classified by the above categories due to the types of damage they can theoretically cause. Patches of all types have been classified as fringe, ranging from complex mechanical weapons like guns and grenades to non-damaging objects like sports balls, books, or nets.</p>
                        <p>While non-damaging weapons may seem counterintuitive to the purpose of patches, they were not manifested on a whim, and many Solutions Architects urge Hosts to pay careful attention to Branch Ops to discover ways in which these unique patches can swing the Branch in their favor.</p>
                      </dd>
                    </div>

                <h3>Merging Patches</h3>
                <p>The concept of merging patches is a relatively new phenomenon quickly gaining popularity as a new approach to addressing Branches, most often exercised by peers, rather than practiced by CVRS agents. Patches can only be merged during staging, outside of the Branch Arena, where their composition is the most fluid and malleable. While there are no interpersonal requirements to merging patches, many have reported higher rates of success when merging the patches of the Host and their primary Adjunct(s). Reports of two Adjuncts merging a patch have been reported, but not documented.</p>
                <p>The process of merging patches is as straightforward as it sounds and entails simply “mashing” the two patches together gently, so as to not damage them. The structure and details of the merged patch will only be visible once the Adjunct has entered the Branch Arena and the Branch is in production.</p>
                <p>It should be noted that the end product will not always be helpful, nor is stability always guaranteed. A merged patch can be wielded by both parties. Two separate patches will always merge into one, while dual patches merged with single patches may result in either one or two merged patches. Two sets of dual patches are likely to result in a dual merged patch, and so on.</p>
                <p>After the Branch has terminated, merged patches are split into their pre-merged compositions and returned to their respective wielders. Merging is not guaranteed to result in the same product every time—nor is merging guaranteed every time—and should not be relied on as a method for addressing Branches.</p>
                <p>The act of merging patches is a novel concept and has not been studied thoroughly. Research and case studies are currently being conducted by our body of Branch Analysts. Due to its variability, CVRS cannot recommend merging patches as a viable method in addressing branches.</p>

                <h2 id="support">Treatments and Support</h2>
                <p>When a Host is infected with a Vice, there are a handful of ways to support the body's attempts at combating an advancing Vice. These treatment plans may be proposed when meeting with a Vice Management Specialist.</p>
                <h3 id="suppressants">Suppressants</h3>
                <p>If a Host has particularly bothersome blights, especially if they are a danger to themself or others, a short-term prescription of Suppressants may be administered. Suppressants are similar in function to painkillers in that they block the signals to the brain that prompt the body to spawn blights. They do not actually address the source of the problem&mdash;often an agitated or advancing Vice&mdash;and are, therefore, not intended for long-term use. Repeated use of Suppressants mask the severity of blights, which often leads to rogue Branches that would otherwise be detectable through changes in a Host’s blights. They are intended to be taken on an as-needed basis for short-term relief or in the event of lingering blights in a cleared Host. Suppressants, ultimately, are a way to offer relief, not treatment.</p>
                <h3 id="avshots">AVShots</h3>
                <p>AVShots can be administered on a regular or as-needed basis, depending upon the patient’s needs. Exposure Rescission is the process of administering repeated AVShots, monitored by an AV Specialist and Vice Management Specialist, to slowly chip away at the Vice core. AVShots can also be used in an emergency to perform suspension and buy the Host time to enlist the proper support. AVShots are only administered by CVRS agents and are not distributed to Hosts so as to prevent misuse. AVShots, when administered outside of a threat, are known to instigate Branches, and can impart physical harm on the Host with repeated misuse.</p>
                <h3 id="vgms">Vitiumglomerorum Management Scan (VGMS)</h3>
                <p>While under the care of a Vice Management Specialist, a Host will likely be administered multiple Vitiumglomerorum Management Scans (VGMS) to monitor the growth of their Vice. These scans produce a low-resolution black and white image of the Vice core, similar to that of an ultrasound. These scans can also detect well-established networks, especially those in more mature Vices. VGMS are a way for Vice Management Specialists to track the progress of an advancing Vice and are particularly helpful if a patient is taking Suppressants. Vices of the --kappa subclass are capable of camouflaging their networks, which often evade detection via VGMS. This camouflaging ability sometimes extends to the core, though doing so is quite energy-intensive and tends to fluctuate in efficacy.</p>
                <h3 id="enhancement">AV Enhancement</h3>
                <p>While AV are native to and produced by our bodies, some Hosts have higher outputs than others and require regular AV Enhancement sessions. These sessions can aid in different stages in a Host's journey, such as summoning and restoring patches or bolstering daily AV output to combat excessive blights.</p>
                <p>AV Enhancement is often used for Hosts who would benefit from Suppressants, but have a Vice with a higher threat level. While Suppressants completely block the production of blights, AV Enhancement allows the body to naturally defend against an advancing Vice without masking its condition. This leads to fewer, less extreme blights, but does not block them altogether. Hosts struggling to establish their patch or restore their patch between excessive Branches can also benefit from regular AV Enhancement sessions.</p>
                <p>Treatments typically entail making physical contact with an active source of AV, often in the form of physical touch between an AV Specialist and the Host. Note that not all Hosts benefit from AV Enhancement, as some Hosts reject external sources of AV. In this instance, an AV Specialist focuses on enhancing the production of AV through natural means, such as meditation or environmental changes.</p>
