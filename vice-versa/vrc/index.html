                <p>Vicemortiferum [VEE-seh-mohr-TI-fehr-um] or more commonly known as "Vices", are parasitic creatures that draw their energy from the products of our body&rsquo;s endocrine system. They feed and grow from many of the hormones released as we live our lives, such as cortisol, adrenaline, and epinephrine. Vicology, as a field of study, is still quite young and widely under-represented in the research sector, due in large part to the unique and volatile nature of Vices. The true origin of Vices is unknown to this day.</p>
                <p>Though, despite their unpredictable and varying natures, experts have been able to observe shared behaviors and create classifications, which will be covered in this compendium. Future versions will be distributed as we learn more about the ever-evolving field of Vicology.</p>
                <p>The presence of a Vice is at best, inconsequential, and at worst, lethal; though, the advent of a Vice is not necessarily a death sentence. In fact, the majority of Hosts live long, full lives with their Vices, and many Hosts with less severe Vice classifications are able to keep them under control on their own. Regardless, Hosts&mdash;especially those with more severe classifications&mdash;are encouraged to enlist the help of an Adjunct(s) or Vice Management Specialist and establish a support system as early in the process as possible.</p>
                <p>During a Vice&rsquo;s life cycle, a Host will become accustomed to the phenomenon known as a Branch, wherein the Vice floods the Host&rsquo;s body with vitiumglomerorum&mdash;spore-like molecules that inhibit the immune system and facilitate Vice reproduction&mdash;and traps the Host&rsquo;s consciousness in a dream-like environment while it attempts to spread throughout the body. Host are able to rid their body of their Vice through the process of rescission, where they destroy the Vice core during an active Branch. The process of rescission looks different between different classifications of Vices, but can generally be prepared for by observing a Vice's behavior in previous Branches. This compendium covers rescission and the different ways that Branches can be addressed if rescission is not immediately possible.</p>
