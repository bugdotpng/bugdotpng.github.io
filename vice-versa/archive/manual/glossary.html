                <dd>Anyone drawn into a Host’s Branch during Staging; a person is drawn into a Branch if they are in physical contact with the Host while a Branch is being Staged. If that person is also touching someone else, they have a chance to be brought in as well, though the chances are much slimmer. See more in <a href="./adjuncts.html">The Role of Adjuncts</a>.</dd>

                <dt id="advent">Advent <span class="extra">(noun &bull; /ˈæd vɛnt/)</span></dt>
                <dd>The birth of a Vice, officially classifying a Host as Active. Advents are categorized as either Sudden or Gradual.
                    <dl>
                        <dt>Sudden Advent</dt>
                        <dd>When the Vice’s birth is tied directly to a specific event and the manifestation of the Vice Core nearly immediately follows after. Sudden Advents typically result in a rogue Branch, though due to the Vice’s immaturity, Committing said Branch is often achieved unintentionally after the Vice retreats from lack of energy. Vices with Sudden Advents are not inherently easier to treat, though their Advent and the resulting Branch often give valuable insight into properties of the Vice’s Core that aid in successfully addressing future Branches and achieving Resolution.
                        </dd>
                        <dt>Gradual Advent</dt>
                        <dd>When the Vice’s creation slowly happens over time; no one event or emotion is tied to the Vice’s Core, making it more difficult to determine its properties. Vices with Gradual Advents are not inherently more complex, though they do have a higher chance of reaching maturity. Vices with a Gradual Advent are typically indicated by increased and uncharacteristic fatigue and are often accidentally detected via ultrasound or other medical imaging.

                <dt id="berserk">Berserk <span class="extra">(adjective &bull; /bərˈsɜrk/)</span></dt>
                <dd>A Host Phase where the Vice Core has begun expanding along its Track Network and the Host is in danger of the Vice Core fusing with their body. This phase is typically the result of an unaddressed or failed Branch. During this phase, emotions run high, and Blights are often agitated and unpredictable. Committing a Branch will return a Host to the Active phase, but we do recommend initiating Rescission if prepared, as Hosts are likely to return to this phase without much provocation.

                <dt id="blight">Blight <span class="extra">(noun &bull; /blaɪt/)</span></dt>
                <dd>Blights are not a physical extension of a Vice; rather, Vices are closer to being extensions of a Host’s body, influenced by a Vice’s Exhibition and abilities. Blights can mirror a Vice’s Exhibition in varying degrees, depending on phase, maturity and severity. See more in <a href="./blights.html">What are Blights?</a>.

                <dt id="branch">Branch <span class="extra">(noun &bull; /bræntʃ/)</span></dt>
                <dd>A Vice’s attempt at distracting a Host while it focuses on expanding its Track Network, not to be confused with Rescission; during Branches, Vices will fabricate an environment in an attempt to disorient and confuse the Host, in what many describe as a hallucination, dream or deja vu episode. Branches are not real in a tangible sense, though the events of a Branch can affect reality in some instances, though typically on a much smaller or less intense scale. If the Branch remains unaddressed and continues for too long, the Vice will begin spreading its Core along the established Track Network, resulting in a Berserk Host. See more in <a href="./branches.html">What to Expect in a Branch</a>.</dd>

            <div class="description-block">
                <dt id="bunker">Bunker <span class="extra">(noun &bull; /ˈbʌŋ kər/)</span></dt>
                <dd>Typically observed in Vices with a high or critical threat level, Bunkers are external resource hoards where a Vice stores extra energy gathered from a Host, typically during times of stress. It is considered to be a direct copy, albeit a smaller one, of the original Vice Core and is connected via the dense cords of external Tracks originating from the Vice Core's Track Network. Generally speaking, it is a less mature version of the original Vice Core and can be disconnected at any time or when a Host strays too far from the Bunker. Vices with established Bunkers are extremely draining on the Host, and the dense, inflexible Tracks connecting the original Vice to its Bunker makes it extremely energy depleting for a Host to break free.</dd>

            <div class="description-block">
                <dt id="comatose">Comatose <span class="extra">(adjective &bull; /ˈkɒm əˌtoʊs/)</span></dt>
                <dd>A Host Phase where the Vice Core has successfully fused with over 75% of a Host's physical body due to lack or failure of action during the Berserk phase; in this Phase, motor control is inhibited and the Vice has flooded the system with lethal amounts of serotonin. The Vice Core is stretched extremely thin during this process and is incredibly vulnerable to attacks from Patches. A Comatose Host is unresponsive to the physical world, though any attempts at Recission would need to be made swiftly, as Hosts do not last for long in this phase.</dd>
            </div> 

            <div class="description-block">
                <dt id="resolution">Commit <span class="extra">(verb &bull; /kəˈmɪt/)</span></dt>
                <dd>One of three potential paths to take during Branches, Committing a Branch entails threatening the Vice Core or causing enough damage to the Exhibition during the Production phase of a Branch. This is the most common action taken during a Branch and is what is recommended if Rescission is not attainable. Committing a Branch allows the Vice to expend excessive amounts of energy and often forces the Vice to retract any fresh growth achieved during Germination to maintain its energy levels. If a Vice favors growth over energy, the next Branch will only occur after the Vice is able to replenish its energy levels. Committing a Branch buys more time between Branches than Suspension, and often provides the Host or any present Adjuncts with more information to perform a successful Rescission.</dd>

            <div class="description-block">
                <dt id="core">Core <span class="extra">(noun &bull; /kɔr/)</span></dt>
                <dd>Considered to be the actual, physical embodiment of a Vice, if a Vice Core is destroyed, the Vice is Resolved and ultimately destroyed. Not to be confused with its Exhibition, Vice Cores typically reside inside the Host’s physical body much like a tumor or parasite. They have proven to be quite difficult to observe at a cellular level, often triggering threatening Branches when sharp instruments come near, though they can be detected and monitored via PI and VIM Scans, respectively. Vice Cores are thought to influence Exhibitions (and therefore Blights) and hold the key to a successful Rescission. Learn more in <a href="./bio.html">Vice Biology</a>.

                <dt id="exhibition">Exhibition <span class="extra">(noun &bull; /ˌɛk səˈbɪʃ ən/)</span></dt>
                <dd>The visual manifestation of a Vice and the origin of Blights; Vices create Exhibitions as a means to inflict fear and distract the Host as a Branch progresses. Often influenced by its Core and Advent, a Vice’s Exhibition can also be as unique as its Host, and many Hosts with similar Vice Cores have different Vice Exhibitions. Exhibitions can be observed in Branches, but more accurately in Rescissions. Most, if not all, Vices have a predominantly black Exhibition with one or two accent colors. Exhibitions typically lean more animalistic and less humanoid, though some Vices are bipedal. A Vice’s Exhibition typically adheres to the structure of a head, torso, appendages, and tail. Appendages can be either arms, legs, or wings, though some Vices have wings instead of arms, or have more of a snake-like lower body. Their skin can range from human-like, to scales, to feathers, to goopy, tacky, and tar-like. Their skin is also often known to have specific properties, such as high acidity or shocking capabilities. Be it known that Vice Exhibitions are incredibly unique, and often determined by a Host’s personal experiences or even fears. Exhibitions can only be observed by the Host and any Adjuncts present and do not exist outside of Branches.</dd>

            <div class="description-block">
                <dt id="exhibition">Germination <span class="extra">(noun &bull; / jûr′mə-nā′shən/)</span></dt>
                <dd>The process of a Vice expanding its Track Network, most commonly occurring during Branches, with the ultimate goal of Propagation; Vices initiate Branches as a way to distract the Host from the process of Germination, as the Host's body tends to mount a violent inflammatory response in reaction to this advancement. Otherwise, Germination is performed at an incredibly minute scale so as to avoid detection.</dd>

            <div class="description-block">
                <dt id="host">Host <span class="extra">(noun &bull; /hoʊst/)</span></dt>
                <dd>A person with a Vice; deemed insensitive by some, it is a word more commonly found in research spaces, rather than everyday life. The relationship between a Host and their Vice is evident by this terminology and is often regarded as parasitic, though in less extreme cases, Hosts have been seen to live with their Vices their entire lives, managed with the help of Adjuncts and Suppressants. As stated before: Everyone possesses the ability to become a Host, but the probability fluctuates based on environment, personal characteristics, and past Vice-related encounters.</dd>

            <div class="description-block">
                <dt id="tracks">Track / Track Network <span class="extra">(noun &bull; /træk ˈnɛtˌwɜrk/)</span></dt>
                <dd>A Track is a dense concentration of positive ions extending from a Vice's Core, with the overarching collection of these tendril-like appendages being referred to as the Track Network; Tracks are used to traverse throughout a Host's body without moving the Core and ultimately provide a safe, nutrient-rich path for the Core to expand along during Germination. These networks collect and send hormones to the Vice Core, where it feeds. Tracks are capable of extending beyond a Host's physical body and are the connection between the Core and its Bunker. This network can only be severed if a Host strays too far from an established Bunker. Thicker networks often result in achy joints and are capable of restricting a Host's movement when particularly severe and have been known to keep Hosts within a specified radius if the Core has established a Bunker.</dd>

            <div class="description-block">
                <dt id="patch">Patch <span class="extra">(noun &bull; /pætʃ/)</span></dt>
                <dd>A physical manifestation of a Host’s body attempting to protect it, typically an extremely dense collection of negative ions; not all Hosts obtain Patches, and little is known about what parameters urge a Host’s body to do so. Patches range in appearance and function and often resemble weapons or defenses, crafted especially to counter the Host’s Vice. Many experts believe that the creation of a Patch is the body’s way of telling a Host that a Vice is changing or approaching a threatening status.

            </div>

            <div class="description-block">
                <dt id="patch">Propagation <span class="extra">(noun &bull; /ˌprɒp əˈgeɪ ʃən/)</span></dt>
                <dd>The ultimate goal of a Vice, wherein the Vice Core overtakes and consumes the Host's body from the inside out; after the body is completely consumed by the Core, it explodes into a fine mist of mold- or fungus-like spores that can be embedded into those nearby. A person ingesting or inhaling a spore will not result in the birth of a Vice, but experts do believe that higher concentrations of spores found in the body can lead to the ideal conditions for Advents of both varieties. This, however, proves difficult to measure, as these spores are difficult to measure with our current technology.</dd>

            <div class="description-block">
                <dt id="rescission">Rescind <span class="extra">(verb &bull; /rɪˈsɪnd/)</span></dt>
                <dd>The act of a Host separating from their Vice, preventing the Core from fusing with the Host. Doing so is an extremely risky move, as the Vice often becomes erratic, unpredictable, and desperate, unable to survive separated from its Host for long; however, Rescission is necessary to Resolve a Vice and is deemed successful once a Vice’s Core is destroyed. Rescission can only be performed once, and either results in Resolution or Propagation.</dd>
            </div> 
            <div class="description-block">
                <dt id="resolution">Resolution <span class="extra">(noun &bull; /ˌrɛz əˈlu ʃən/)</span></dt>
                <dd>The end goal of most Hosts, achieved by a successful Rescission; Resolution only refers to Hosts that have completed a successful Rescission or have been able to progress through the Comatose phase. Vices that have been Resolved are still capable of reignition through future Advents, though the threat is low and has only been observed in severe cases. Lingering Blights are not uncommon, and can be dealt with the help of Suppressants.</dd>
            </div>

            <div class="description-block">
                <dt id="resolution">Suspend <span class="extra">(verb &bull; /səˈspɛnd/)</span></dt>
                <dd>One of three potential paths to take during Branches, Suspending a Branch entails threatening the Vice Core or rendering the Host unstable or unconscious during Staging or early Production. This is typically ill-advised, as doing so often agitates the Vice and results in more frequent Branches. Suspension should only be performed as a last result, particularly to buy more time to prepare.</dd>
