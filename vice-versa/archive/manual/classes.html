        <h1>Classifying Vices</h1>
        <p>Vices are classified based on their behaviors and characteristics. Receiving a professional classification is encouraged, as some Vices are known to be deceiving or are difficult to observe. Vice classifications can be further categorized by their threat level, ranging from low to critical. This threat level informs Intake Coordinators and Vice Management Specialists on what materials or staff are needed for treatment, denotes the probability of rogue Branches, and outlines the probability for success.

                    <dt id="alpha">Alpha <span class="threat low">Low</span></dt>
                    <dd>Alpha Vices are the most common and easiest to treat due to their shared formula of 1) a Sudden Advent (and therefore a straightforward Core), 2) non-threatening Blights, and 3) regular, predictable Branches. Alpha Vices rarely progress past the adloscent stage and only occassionally result in Berserk Hosts. Rescission is often pursued at this stage. Alpha Vices account for the large majority of Vices at roughly 75% of all documented and classified Vices.</dd>

                <div class="description-block">
                    <dt id="beta">Beta <span class="threat med">Medium</span></dt>
                    <dd>The Beta classification refers to Vices that would otherwise be classified as Alpha Vices, but deviate from one of the diganostic criteria. For example, if a Vice has a Suddent Advent and predictable Branches, but Blights are unmanageable, they are classified as a Beta Vice. They are slightly more complicated because of said deviations, but they are still generally simple to treat with the correct preparation. Because of these deviations and due to incorrect classifications, Beta Vices are known to progress Hosts to the Berserk stage more often than Alpha Vices. Beta Vices account for roughly 10% of all documented and classified Vices.

                    <dt id="delta">Delta <span class="threat low">Low</span></dt>
                    <dd>Delta Vices are fairly uncommon and harder to treat due to their unpredictable nature. Delta Cores are known to change and shift over time or can change in response to external stimuli that seemingly threaten its security within the Host. Shifting Cores is time- and energy-intensive, and with each shift, the Vice essentially starts from ground zero, neutralizing any previous threats. Because of this, Hosts typically stay in the Active phase, though there have been cases that progressed to the Berserk phase, typically in the event of a Vice shifting to a Core that takes immediate advantage of the Host's emotional and physiological environment. This rapid and persistent cycling often results in a Host's exhaustion and frustration, driving them to seek treatment via an early Rescission.

                    <dd>Also quite rare, Epsilon Vices are much harder to treat because of their deceptive nature. While the actual Core of Delta Vices shift, Epsilon Cores are known to change their Blights or Branch formulae on a whim to avoid accurate classification and treatment and ultimately deter Rescission. If agitated or threatened, Epsilon Vices can quickly advance and push a Host to the Berserk phase, where they often present their true Core and Exhibition in a rogue Branch, aiming for Propagation. Because the Host is often unprepared, Epsilon Vices are more likely to result in a Comatose Host&mdash;and in extreme cases, successful Propagation&mdash;compared to other, less threatening classifications. &ndash;&ndash;Eta subclasses often accompany Epsilon classifications.

                    <dd>Zeta Vices are categorized by their excessive feeding in the larval stage, often driving Hosts to seek treatment early on. Due to their relaxed preferences, Zeta Vices feed as much and as often as possible, growing quickly while also draining a Host in very observable ways. Zeta Vices are among one of the only Vices to have such visible effects on a Host, usually in the form of drastic weight loss, pale skin, and exaggerated undereye bags. Though many seek treatment in the larval stage, Rescinding a Zeta Vices often poses a unique threat. Due to their immaturity, Hosts typically have not experienced many Branches&mdash;if any at all&mdash;and the Vice's properties are unknown. If a Host waits too long to begin treatment, a Vice can quickly advance to the adolescent stage where rogue Branches are more likely. We recommend treating with a Vice Management Specialist as soon as possible.</dd>

                    <dt id="theta">Theta <span class="threat med">Medium</span></dt>
                    <dd>Theta Vices are the most chaotic of the Vices and deviate from any Vice-psychology norms that experts have observed. While many Vices have the very understable goal to survive, Theta Vices thrive on chaos and aim to consume as many victims as possible, often taking itself down in the process. Theta Vices behave much like Alpha Vices in their early larval stage, observed in a handful of regular, run-of-the-mill Branches. Hosts are then taken by surprise when Theta Vices inevitably trigger an explosive, rogue Branch&ndash;&ndash;typically in a public, crowded setting&ndash;&ndash;that draws in numerous Tertiary Adjuncts. Experts posit that this is an attempt to disorient and catch the Host off guard, though some believe this is actually due to the impatient and immature nature of these Vices and any theories about intelligence are misguided. This is an extremely costly maneuver that often leaves Theta Vices brittle and suspectible to Resolution via Rescission.

                    <dt id="lambda">Lambda <span class="threat high">High</span></dt>
                    <dd>Lambda Vices are quite rare and start out overwhelming and unmanageable in a catastrophic Sudden Advent, causing a Host to jump from Latent to Berserk without warning. Lambda Vices are highly likely to result in a Comatose Host because the Host has no prior Branches to aid in Committing, let alone Rescission. Though, if successfully Committed, Lambda Vices become easier to treat over time. Each Branch following the Advent is less agressive and less sudden and often follows the same formula as the rogue Branch experienced at Advent, making for a seamless Rescission.

                    <dt id="phi">Phi <span class="threat low">Low</span></dt>
                    <dd>A rare and bizarre classification of Vice that is so chaotic and dysfunctional that it deteriorates shortly after its Sudden Advent. While its Advent may be intimidating and off-putting, it is nowhere near as dangerous as Lambda Vices, as seen through the disjointed and incoherent Branch present at Advent. Additionally, its structural integrity is so poor that it can be Resolved without inciting a Rescission (through successfully Committing a Branch, for example), or it will deteriorate on its own. This is quite a rare classification of Vice, however, so all Advents should be approached with the proper care and attention. Do not let this single classification of Vices lure you into a false sense of security. Likewise, Hosts with Phi Vices should stay vigilant, as the chances of reigniting with a different classification of Vice are fairly high. The presence of a Phi Vice confirms that the Host has the necessary conditions to harbor Vices. 50% of Hosts with Phi Vices have another Advent that results in a new classification of Vice. 15% reignite with another Phi Vice, raising their 50% chance of reignition to 75%.

                    <dd>Extremely rare and often regarded as fatal, not much can be said about Omega Vices as a whole. This classification is often applied post-Propagation, as the properties of Omega Vices tend to shift in ways that other classifications do not, making classification particularly difficult. The Omega classification is reserved for Vices that cannot be categorized by any of the classifications outlined above, essentially acting as a fringe category of Vices with no shared characteristics other than their intensity and threat level. While Rescission is typically encouraged, Hosts with Omega Vices typically do not have enough information to initiate one successfully. Hosts are generally advised to not engage unless absolutely necessary.</dd>

            <h3>Secondary Classes (Subclasses)</h3>
            <p>In certain cases, further classification may be applied to provide a more complete understanding of a Host’s Vice, called subclasses. Many of these subclasses are applied after extensive observation and interaction, and in extreme cases, can be the difference between life and death. While Vices can manifest in a multitude of ways, the subclasses below are merely observed groups of similar behaviors and characteristics among varying Vice classes and are the result of experts’ limited knowledge. It is highly likely subclasses outside of these exist.</p>
            <p>Subclasses are denoted with a leading double-hyphen and do not include threat levels. Refer to the primary classification to assess any threats.</p>

                <div class="description-block">
                    <dt id="gamma">&ndash;&ndash;Gamma</dt>
                    <dd>This subclass refers to any Vices with three sets of a specific body part in its Exhibition (3 heads, 3 tails, or 6 arms, for example). Vices with this subclass often work to obscure two of the three sets in order to throw off Hosts and Adjuncts. A Gamma Vice never stores their Core anywhere in the duplicated parts, which easily regenerate unless the Core itself is addressed.

                <div class="description-block">
                    <dt id="kappa">&ndash;&ndash;Kappa</dt>
                    <dd>A rather uncommon subclass that refers to Vices that are “contagious”, meaning they can transfer between Hosts. This is uncommon, since Vices come from and thrive off the very specific conditions provided by their Host, and transferring Hosts puts the Vice at risk of transferring to an inhospitable environment. If this is the case, the Vice’s Core deteriorates and the Vice is considered Resolved. Though uncommon, this is typically only observed when a particularly mature Vice feels threatened, and a Host with seemingly identical conditions are within range. The Kappa subclass is only applied once the Vice has transferred Hosts, the original Host being considered Cleared. For the new Host, this transaction is often classified as a Sudden Advent, beginning the cycle anew.

                <div class="description-block">
                    <dt id="eta">&ndash;&ndash;Eta</dt>
                    <dd>An extremely rare subclass that is often applied post-Propagation, as Vices with this subclass seem to exhibit sentience and are, therefore, incredibly deadly and nearly impossible to Resolve without the proper resources. Vices with this subclass have been known to observe and document its Host's behaviors, even going so far as hearing and recording thoughts. Many &ndash;&ndash;Eta Vices are known to communicate verbally, though this has only been observed in initiated Branches, where they have been observed to barter and manipulate a Host and their Adjuncts. Only Vices with a high or critical threat level are capable of having the &ndash;&ndash;Eta subclass, as any Vices with a lower threat level have not been known to exhibit sentience.

                <div class="description-block">
                    <dt id="tau">&ndash;&ndash;Tau-Antitau</dt>
                    <dd>A rare and unique subclass of Vices that can be Resolved without Rescissions, these subclasses often being applied after Resolution. Vices with the Tau or Antitau subclass can be Resolved through the normal procedures determined by its primary classification, but these Vices are also capable of being Resolved by a Host who has a Vice that is the exact, physiological opposite of the other Host’s being brought in as an Adjunct during a Branch. The Tau subclass is applied to the Vice that initially incites the Branch, and the Vice on the defensive receives the Antitau subclass. The result of their clashing is a powerful exchange&mdash;progressing both Hosts from Active > Berserk > Cleared in a matter of minutes&mdash;that leaves both Hosts with their Vices Resolved. This is an extremely exhausting process that often leaves both Hosts unresponsive for days at a time.
