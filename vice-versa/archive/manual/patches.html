        <h1>Patches: How They Can Help</h1>
        <p>Patches are densely-packed negative ions--often in the shape of traditional weapons--that can help Hosts and Adjuncts sucessfully address Branches. Open Patches outside of Branches interact with our physical bodies similar to wind or water, in that their direct contact does not harm us, but at concentrated speeds, can leave bruises or even pierce through skin. Within Branches, they can deal devastating damage, though this typically only manifests afterward as sore muscles and joints.</p>
        <p>The origin of Patches is unknown, though many experts speculate that the manifestation of negative ions came from our body's immune response to the sudden increase in positive ions from the Vice Core.</p>
        <p>Patches are first observed in a Host as a burst of negative ions, typically observed as thin beams of light quickly sparking from fingertips, shoulders, ears, or noses. This is thought to be the body's subconscious response to a particularly threatening Vice, though not all Hosts are able to manifest Patches when threatened. Over time, as a Host learns to subconsciously concetrate said bursts, the bursts of ions last longer and weapons or other useful obejcts begin to form. Being a subconscious process, Hosts typically cannot control what the end result will be, and are often advised to focus on ion concentration, rather than perfecting a specific form.</p>
        <p>Patches are most commonly manifested in Branches as a means of protection, though particularly seasoned Hosts and Adjuncts have been known to call their Patches as a Branch is being Staged to use it as a means of Suspending the Branch.</p>
        <p>When patches make contact with human skin outside of a Branch, a brief burst of negative ions emanate from the point of contact. Repeated use of Patches can lead to degredation over time if the Patch is not given time to recover. Patches do not lose concentration within the parameters of a Branch.</p>
        <p>At high speeds, Patches outside of Branches threaten coming into contact with a Vice Core, either via piercing the skin with a slashing weapon or the burst of negative ions released from a blunt object. If executed properly, this forces the Vice to retreat, resulting in a Suspended Branch. CVRS does not recommend this approach, which is further explored in <a href="#branches">What to Expect in a Branch</a>.</p>
