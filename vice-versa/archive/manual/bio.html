        <h1>Vice Biology</h1>
        <p>When most think of a Vice, their Exhibition is what comes to mind. Though their Exhibition is what a Host would encounter in a Branch and see manifested through Blights, the only physical, tangible part of a Vice is their Core. Cores have been likened to both tumors and parasites, but many vicologists struggle to find a word that accurately portrays what a Vice truly is.</p>
        <p>Because Vices cannot exist separate from their Host&mdash;except in extreme cases&mdash;collecting samples and gathering high-level diagnostic data about these creatures has proven extremely difficult. What we do know about their biological makeup and behavior has been outlined below.</p>
        <h2>Properties of Life</h2>
        <p>Vices are considered to be "alive", according to the widely-understood properties of life, summarized below.</p>
<ul class="characteristics">
    <li><a href="#bio-order">Order</a>: Vice Cores are comprised of cells and are considered organic matter, often beginning as a benign growth embedded in the Host's flesh.</li>
    <li><strong>Response to Stimuli</strong>: Vices are extremely protective of their Cores and often (if not always) lash out when threatened, making sample collection difficult.</li>
    <li><strong>Reproduction</strong>: Vices are capable of reproduction in a process not dissimilar to molds and mushrooms that release spores.</li>
    <li><strong>Growth and Development</strong>: Vices have been observed to follow a life cycle, outlined below.</li>
    <li><strong>Homeostasis and Regulation</strong>: Vices are known to require specific conditions to thrive, and have even been observed performing thermoregulation or thickening the outer layer of their Cores.</li>
    <li><strong>Energy Processing</strong>: Vices are known to "feed" off a selection of hormones present in their Host's system and have been documented "preferring" certain hormones over others.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="bio-order">Vice Order</h3>
<p>The only corporeal part of a Vice is its Core. While Branches can result in physical distress and Exhibitions can influence Blights, these are “side effects” of these phenomena, rather than direct extensions of them. Blights are not considered part of the biological makeup of Vices, and are more akin to sores or growths <em>caused</em> by the Core.</p>
<p>The exact biological composition of a Vice’s Core is unknown, though we can say that it mimics cancerous tumors due to the circumstances surrounding its inception. All Vices begin as a benign mass of soft tissue, typically found in fatty tissue or embedded in muscle fibers. Cancerous tumors typically do not turn into Vice Cores, as the abnormal cancer cells often take over the early stages of a Vice's inception. The current theory among experts is that the act of Propagation aids in Vice reproduction, and that the nanoparticles expelled during Propagation find their way into these benign masses. These nanoparticles are believed to cause "errors" in the cells of the bengign mass, essentially acting as a cancer to the body. Many Vices are not born from this arrangement, however, as hormone levels in the Host's body need to reach and maintain a certain threshold in order for the Vice to survive in its early stages. It is believed that particularly strong immune systems are also capable of deploying enough resources to rid a potential Host of this threat.</p>
<p>After enough nanoparticles have established themselves in a soft mass, a Vice will manifest in one of two ways: a Sudden Advent or Gradual Advent. In the case of a Sudden Advent, the body is flooded with an influx of hormones, often in the case of a stressful or traumatic event, causing exponential growth of the "error" cells and resulting in a Vice Core. In the case of a Gradual Advent, there is no rush of hormones, rather a steady stream of elevated levels over an extended period of time. Because of this, it is difficult to say when the mass becomes a Vice Core, but the Host is considered Active once a positive P.I. Scan is made.</p>
<p>Many Vice Cores are first discovered accidentally, detected via ultrasounds or other medical imaging techniques. Vice Cores typically present as masses of soft tissue in ultrasounds or solid white nodules in MRIs, for example. It has become a common practice for medical professionals to issue subsequent P.I. scans after detecting unexpected masses in their patients.</p>
<p>The Vice Core is typically embedded deep in muscle fibers or fatty tissue and avoids vital organs or high-mobility areas like joints. Most common, low-threat Vices typically range from 10mm to 15mm in diameter, while more mature or high-threat Vices have measured up to 60mm. They aim to be as inconspicuous as possible to avoid any early detection, though it is uncommon that a Host is able to physically feel an embedded Vice Core prior to detection via P.I. Scan.</p>
<p>After a positive P.I. Scan, Hosts are encouraged to attend regular checkups to detect any progression or growth of the Vice Core. P.I. Scans merely detect and do not measure an increase in positive ions. Vice Ion Measurement (VIM) Scans combine traditional medical imaging techniques with the technology used to initially detect ions to measure the growth of a Vice Core, shown below. VIM Scans are typically much more expensive than PI Scans, and thus require an initial PI Scan to be approved for use. Read more about growth patterns in <a href="#bio-growth">Vice Growth</a>.</p>

<p>Vices obtain information from stimuli through a dense concentration of positive ions that extend from its Core, known as the Track Network. These tendril-like appendages extend throughout a Host's body and send information, such as blood pressure fluctuations or changes in hormone levels, back to the Vice Core. These Tracks are also able to send hormones back to the Core to feed when supply is low. A Track Network is essentially how a Vice is able to "see" the world around their Host and learn their behaviors in order to brace for any impending threats.</p>
<p>Vices react to perceived threats by initiating Branches. They are often used to distract a Host if a Vice feels that it is losing a clear view of the Host's status, often the result of unexpected biofeedback or a sudden drop in hormones. Many Vices spend their Larval stage building Track Networks and gathering data about its Host; this is believed to be why Branches rarely occur during the Larval stage. The Adolescent phase is often more chaotic for the following reasons: 1) the Vice "believes" it has a clear understanding of its Host and best knows how to take advantage of them&mdash;with the end goal of Propagation, and 2) the Vice panics when and if a Host deviates from its supposed observations (as humans are prone to do) and scrambles to regain control via Branches. Mature Vices have a much more comprehensive view of their Host and are more strategic in their Branch initiations, resulting in fewer Branches during this phase.</p>
<p>In rare and extreme cases, some Vices have “outgrown” their Host and were successful in planting themselves outside of the Host’s physical body. In many of these instances, the Core creates a smaller duplicate of itself to embed externally, where it sends extra energy it gathers in what many experts refer to as a "Bunker". This is an extension of the Vice itself, tied to its Core by an extremely dense cord of ionic tunnels. While never observed in a laboratory setting, many witnesses describe Bunkers as deposits of dark, pusling flesh that typically emanate the smells present at Advent. Experts posit that Bunkers are comprised of a cellular makeup similar to that of a Vice Core. While the Tracks that tie a Bunker to its Core are not rigid in a literal sense, the further a Host strays from an established Bunker, the more strain this network has on a Host's body, often seen as complaints of exhaustion, lethargy, and lack of motivation. If the Host strays too far from the Bunker, the network will detatch, rendering the Bunker unusable. Within minutes, the Bunker disintegrates in a small burst of positive ions, often causing acute power surges in the process. Hosts often feel an inexplicable surge of energy or restlessness in the event of detachment. The process of creating Bunkers is typically only observed in mature, intelligent Vices.

<h3 id="bio-reproduction">Reproduction</h3>
<h3 id="bio-growth">Growth and Development</h3>
<h3 id="bio-regulation">Homeostasis and Regulation</h3>
<h3 id="bio-energy">Energy</h3>
<h3 id="bio-drive">Biological Drive</h3>
<p>Vices often have a drive similar to most living creatures on this earth: to survive and repopulate. Vice reproduction is believed to occur as a result of Propagation, the act of a Vice consuming its Host and scattering its energy into the ether. This may seem counter-productive to survival, but many experts believe these particles embed themselves into humans and are what aid in initiating Advents once conditions are favorable. Vices essentially use Humans as a means to gather enough energy for an efficient Propagation, though this is typically only the case for more mature Vices. Many less-threatening Vices aim to achieve this, though they never mature past the larval stage. Only the more aggressive, persistent, and complex Vices reach maturity.
</p>
<h3 id="sentience">Intelligence &amp; Sentience</h3>
<p>The large majority of Vices have levels of intelligence akin to predatory animals, such as snakes or wildcats. This level of intelligence varies between Vices, and is primarily affected by the Vice’s classification and maturity. The large majority of Vices merely strive to survive and repopulate. All Vices have the capacity to observe and learn, but only in rare instances have Vices been known to communicate with humans on a level both it and the Host can understand. This rare display of sentience and self-awareness is exclusive to the Eta subclass. Eta Vices have been known to not only observe and learn about the Host’s behavior, but fight back with psychological warfare, finding tactical advantages against the Host that often render them helpless and terrified and ultimately lead to Propagation. Eta Vices are known to observe and document all Adjuncts, though the Host is the one it focuses its attention on. The higher the level of intelligence, the more imperative an Experienced Adjunct or Vice Management Specialist becomes.
</p>
<h2 id="life-cycle">The Life Cycle of Vices</h2>
<p>Vices typically progress through three stages after Advent: Larval, Adolescent, and Mature. In the event of Propagation, an additional Corporeal stage can be briefly observed. Vices progress through these stages and reach maturity by feeding on any and all negative emotions from its Host, though they prefer and often gorge themselves on the negative emotion(s) specifically tied to their Advent. When a Vice feeds, the waste it excretes often exacerbates the emotion, creating an exponential growth in said emotion that results in reports of fatigue, headaches, dizziness and nausea.
</p>
<p>Not all Vices reach maturity, and while maturity is not necessarily indicative of threat level, more mature Vices tend to be more calculated and dangerous.</p>
<div class="life-cycle">
    <div class="stage">
<h3>Stage 0: Origin and Advent</h3>
<p>A Vice’s life begins at its Advent. Though a Vice does not exist before its Advent, a Host’s experiences can influence the characteristics determined in a Vice’s Advent, leading to the creation of a Vice’s Core and ultimately influencing its future Exhibition. In the event of a Sudden Advent, the Vice Core is immediately detectable by PI Scans and classifies the Host as Active. Conversely, with a Gradual Advent, a Vice’s Core more so “fades” into being, typically being more complex as it picks up multiple properties over time. Once the Vice becomes detectable via PI Scan, the Host is classified as Active.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="stage">
<h3>Stage 1: Larval</h3>
<p>Larval Vices spend the majority of their time storing energy and learning the ebbs and flows of hormones. Branches at this stage are unlikely, and any energy expended by the Vice is dedicated to forming its Exhibition. In this stage, some Hosts report cases of extreme fatigue or disorientation due to a Vice’s excessive, uncontrolled feeding and seek Rescission guided by a Vice Management Specialist. This excessive feeding is primarily observed in Zeta Vices. Please note that Rescission at any stage poses risks. The properties of Larval Vices have not been determined and cannot be prepared for, though the probability of an advanced Exhibition and complex Branches are unlikely. Rescind with a professional only.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stage">
<h3>Stage 2: Adolescent</h3>
<p>An adolescent Vice has solidified its Exhibition and will begin prompting the Host into Branches. Each Branch causes a Vice’s stored energy to be depleted, so repeated Branches in quick succession are unlikely in this stage. Particularly aggressive Vices typically do not stay in this stage for long and often feed on the frustration or fear from their Host, quickly aiding in their maturity. It is in this stage where they learn to balance between feeding and initiating Branches, and they begin observing and documenting their Host’s behavior. Adolescent Vices, while more aggressive than larval Vices, are still impulsive and inexperienced. A successful Rescission is fairly likely in this stage, if desired. If a Vice is particularly aggressive or deceptive, it is highly encouraged to incite Rescission in this stage before it matures further.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stage">
<h3>Stage 3: Mature</h3>
<p>Mature Vices not only have a solidified Exhibition, but have perfected their Branch formula and mastered the art of balancing Branches and feeding, maximizing their energy control. Mature Vices are much more calculated than Adolescent Vices, and while Branches are less common, they’re much more dangerous. Rescission in this stage is a must, though it is extremely risky. It is advised to enlist the help of Experienced Adjuncts as well as a Vice Management Specialist familiar with your case.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stage">
<h3>Fringe Stage 4: Corporeal</h3>
<p>In the event of an unaddressed Branch, a Vice will begin the process of fusing with its Host by spreading its tightly condensed Core along the ionic tunnels embedded throughout the Host. A Vice has successfully fused with its Host after its Core has completely saturated the ionic tunnels, rendering the Rescission unsuccessful. The Core seeps out of the ionic tunnels and consumes the Host from the inside out, gathering energy to initiate Propagation. Any attempts at destroying the Host prematurely at this stage will result in a weaker Propagation, though the window of opportunity is slim, as this consumption stage is often completed in a few minutes. Experts have been unsuccessful in discovering a way to fully destroy a Vice Core at this stage, regardless of how little it has consumed of its Host. If the Vice is able to fully consume its Host, it will be visible for a brief moment before Propagation. Reports claim that the Core resembles a hovering sphere so dark that light cannot escape. The Core is incredibly dense, packing all the extraneous energy absorbed by the Vice into a sphere no larger than a baseball. The initiation of Propagation is akin to a very brief shock wave that sends the absorbed energy back into the ether. The further these energy particles travel, the more they fade from our perception, eventually becoming undetectable. While no concrete evidence has been gathered, many experts believe these particles embed themselves in potential Hosts, waiting for favorable conditions to initiate an Advent and begin the cycle again.
