        <h1>The Role of Adjuncts</h1>
        <p>Many Hosts find Branches to be jarring and disorienting, and often struggle to properly address their Branches alone. Primary and Secondary Adjuncts can increase the success rates, typically by strengthening defenses, increasing firepower, or even serving as a distraction, as noted in the chart below. Adjuncts can fall into 1 of 3 categories: Primary, Secondary, and Tertiary.</p>
        <dl>
            <div class="description-block">
                <dt>Tertiary Adjuncts</dt>
                <dd>Often unassuming strangers brought into Branches by a Vice to throw off the Host, raise stakes, and increase energy consumption if a Vice is aiming for Propagation. Tertiary Adjuncts are uncommon, and typically only associated with more mature or intelligent Vices. Tertiary Adjuncts are brought in via proximity rather than physical touch, so their connections are weak and often lost throughout the course of a Branch. A Vice is also capable of expelling a Tertiary Adjunct if they become too much of a threat.</dd>
            </div>
            <div class="description-block">
                <dt>Secondary Adjuncts</dt>
                <dd>The most common, Secondary Adjuncts are intentionally brought into Branches via physical touch by the Host after identifying a Branch staging. Secondary Adjuncts are capable of calling Patches and are much less likely to be expelled, though it is still possible for less experienced Adjuncts. The more often a Secondary Adjunct is brought in, the easier the process becomes.</dd>
            </div>
            <div class="description-block">
                <dt>Primary Adjuncts</dt>
                <dd>Adjuncts that have Committed multiple Branches for a Host. Because of this, Primary Adjuncts tend to understand a Host’s Vice better than a Tertiary or Secondary Adjunct. Primary Adjuncts are less common, but invaluable during Branches and Rescission, especially. Primary Adjuncts are also capable of forcing their way into Branches if a Host is caught by surprise and a Branch is initiated without their knowing. Primary Adjuncts typically cannot be expelled from Branches, though it has been observed in rare occassions.</dd>

        <p>Primary Adjuncts often affect the above percentages, and typically add a buff of 1.3, so if you have a Vice with a low threat level and 1 (one) Primary Adjunct, your chances of success increase by 54.6% instead of 42%. Likewise, if you have a Vice with a high threat level and 2 (two) Adjuncts (one Primary, the other Secondary), your chances of success increase by 22.86% instead of 18.66%.
        </p>
        <p>Because Rescission varies greatly between Hosts and Vices, it is more difficult to determine how effective Adjuncts will be beforehand. Though we’re unsure of the exact impact Adjuncts have on Rescission, many Rescissions have failed due to lack of Adjuncts, so it is always advised to air on the side of caution and enlist as many Primary and Secondary Adjuncts as possible.
        </p>
        <p>While it is understood that a Host cannot always control their Branches to occur in close proximity to trusted Adjuncts, more experienced Adjuncts can work their way into Branches they were not originally drawn into with practice and precision. Some CVRS agents are able to force their way into Branches with the help of a <a href="#eq-push-manager">Push Manager</a>. Branches often occur on a different timeline than a Host’s surroundings, so a person attempting to join a Branch needs to act quickly and efficiently.
        </p>
        <p>Joining Branches is unfortunately not something that can be broken down into a step-by-step process, because it is unique to each Host and their Adjuncts. Being in touch with a Host's emotions, mind, and body are often key to intentionally joining a Branch.</p>
        <h2 id="pseudo">Pseudo Adjuncts</h3>
        <p>While not common in everyday Branches, some Adjuncts can be brought in as a Pseudo Adjunct, where they are able to view Branches and collect data. This method is primarily practiced by the <a href="#research">Research Sector</a> of CVRS agents and is used to observe Branches and document Vice behavior.</p>
        <p>These Agents are often able to join Branches via proximity, leveraging the channels that Vices often use to draw in Tertiary Adjuncts. Their physical distance from the Host allows them to also observe the Branch from a distance. Pseudo Adjuncts are not affected by Propagation and are immediately expelled once Propagation is complete. The window for observation varies, but is often long enough for <a href="#dispersion-analyst">Dispersion Analysts</a> to document any Vice Behavior in its final moments, though intelligent Vices have been known to expell these Agents once Propagation begins.</p>
