        <p>Vicemortiferum [VEE-seh-mohr-TI-fehr-um] or more commonly known as "Vices", are creatures that manifest and draw their energy from the effects that strong negative emotions can have on our bodies. It is understood that they feed and grow from many of the hormones released as we live our lives, such as cortisol, adrenaline, and epinephrine. Vices, as a field of study, is still widely under-researched, due in large part to the unique nature of both Vices and their Hosts. The exact circumstances that result in the birth of a Vice are still being studied, and the probability fluctuates based on environment, personal characteristics, and past Vice-related encounters.</p>
            </div>
        <p>Despite their unpredictable, varying and unique natures, experts have been able to observe behaviors, create classifications and formulate care plans, which will be covered in this manual. Future versions will be distributed as we learn more about the ever-evolving field of Vicology.</p>
        <p>Vices are considered parasitic in their natural form, providing no benefits to the Host in addition to draining energy and tampering with hormone levels. The presence of a Vice is at best, inconsequential, and at worst, lethal. Though, the Advent of a Vice, especially less aggressive classifications, is not necessarily a death sentence. In fact, the majority of Hosts live long, full lives with their Vices, and many Hosts with less severe Vice classifications are able to keep them under control on their own if they ever even notice them at all. Regardless, Hosts, especially those with more severe Vice classifications, are encouraged to enlist the help of an Adjunct(s) or Vice Management Specialist and establish a support system as early in the process as possible.</p>
        <p>Most Hosts are able to rid their body of their Vice through a process known as Rescission. The process of Rescission looks different between different classifications of Vices, but can generally be prepared for by observing a Vice's behavior in more common situations known as Branches, where a Host can either Suspend or Commit said Branch. This manual covers the process of Recission at a general level and the different ways that Branches can be addressed.</p>
        <p>Vices are often categorized into specific classifications that can be used to predict behaviors, address Branches, or prepare for Rescissions. Professional classification is encouraged, as some Vices are difficult to observe and categorize. Along with a professional classification, many Hosts often seek out Suppressants or Vice Management Therapy. Suppressants are a class of drug specialized in suppressing the manifestation of Blights, which can range from mildly irritating to life-threatening. Suppressants can only be prescribed after a positive PI Scan performed by a Vice Management Specialist. Regular checkups are encouraged to track any potential Vice progression or deviation, which can be monitored with VIM Scans. Vice Management Therapy is often pursued if Suppressants fail to perform or if a Host continues to have adverse side effects after three weeks of regular use.</p>
