        <h1><span class="superhead">1.2.0</span>Liability</h1>
<p>Danny hovered outside the entrance to the bar, the sweat on his brow illuminated by the yellowy-orange neon sign flickering above him. He fidgeted with the box of cigarettes in his pants pocket, contemplating a quick smoke to calm his nerves.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo; Gen poked her head out from around the door. &ldquo;Rami&rsquo;s already got us seats at the bar. You comin&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I just need a minute. Been a while since I&rsquo;ve been out and about, I guess.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She smiled knowingly and joined him to lean against the brick exterior. &ldquo;Take your time. It was a long week.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He scoffed, deciding a cigarette could be his treat for the admittedly long week. Gen held out an engraved lighter with a soft smile, the small flame glinting off the rim of her glasses. He lit his cigarette with a sigh and gave her an acknowledging nod. He took a long drag, then exhaled a stream of smoke from his nose. &ldquo;Sometimes going out feels like arthritis.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gen snorted as she clicked her lighter shut. &ldquo;Huh! Knees bothering you again?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not like actual arthritis, but sorta. It&rsquo;s hard to explain. I feel so&hellip;blah when I go out. Sluggish&hellip;just tired. It&rsquo;s why I haven&rsquo;t been doing much of it lately.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think it&rsquo;s the guilt? From not having seen Eli in a while?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hm,&rdquo; he grunted. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a little more broad than that. Just a general ache.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The burden of being an introvert in an extroverted world, maybe?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He held a long inhale as he seemed to mull it over. &ldquo;Maybe,&rdquo; he exhaled with a puff of smoke. He had never been good at articulating how he felt, no matter how helpful Gen was with her prompts; emotionally, physically, mentally&mdash;he was always quite rudimentary in his assessments. This was a feeling that had plagued him for a while and despite its longevity, he could never find a word better than &ldquo;arthritis&rdquo;. A nagging, aching pain that hung on his joints and weighed on his bones like someone had turned up the gravity. It was nauseating after some time.</p>
<p>Danny took one last drag, then flicked his half-used cigarette on the ground. He dug his foot into the cement and ground the cigarette into an unrecognizable smudge as he greedily held on to his last inhale. Smoke exploded from his mouth as he exhaled a loud groan. &ldquo;Alright, let&rsquo;s do this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He pushed his way through the front door with a puffed chest, still clinging on to any remaining smoke in his lungs. Eli looked up from the bar, and upon recognizing his face, threw his hands out with a large, beaming smile. &ldquo;Danny! There you are!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sorry about that, I needed a quick breather.&rdquo; He sheepishly tapped the cigarette box further into his pocket.</p>
<p>Gen gave him a supportive pat on the back. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s been a long week. You got anything for that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;On me!&rdquo; Emory piped up, already having torn through the majority of their whiskey cocktail. &ldquo;I roped him into some dumb bullshit. I owe him one!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So I&rsquo;ve heard,&rdquo; Eli offered a wry smile. &ldquo;Danny, you mentioned a beer earlier. Dos, as usual?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, not if Emory&rsquo;s paying. Get me a fancy cocktail with expensive tequila. Something top-shelf. Or maybe some mezcal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Emory pulled out a handful of crumpled dollar bills. &ldquo;All&rsquo;s I can get ya&rsquo; is Jose Cuervo, sorry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Danny turned to Eli with a sigh. &ldquo;Dos Equis is fine, yeah.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The longer he was out and the deeper he got into his beer, the ache in his bones seemed to lessen. Or, at the very least, he was distracted and the beer took the edge off. It had been too long since he had gone out, so long, in fact, that he forgot how much he actually enjoyed the company of his friends, as sad as that sounded. It had nothing to do with them and everything to do with the way his brain spiraled when he was alone. The longer he was alone, the worse and more convincing the spirals became.</p>
<p>Gen and Rami were their usual selves with the status updates out of the way. Rami was the master of small talk; Gen, the master of sarcastic quips. And for all their quirks, Emory was actually a fantastic drinking partner and brought a bunch of much-needed life to the group of predominantly introverts.</p>
<p>Danny hung out at the edge, enjoying the conversations from a safe distance. After all, he had nothing of interest to add to Emory&rsquo;s escapades of trespassing and breaking into chain-link fences with bolt cutters, for the sake of&hellip;doing whatever Emory did, Danny wasn&rsquo;t entirely sure. Eli had noticed his reserved behavior and managed to slip away from Emory&rsquo;s spirited monologue.</p>
<p>Gen tugged at his sleeve, wordlessly pointed at Danny&rsquo;s empty beer, then at herself. Eli nodded knowingly and swapped his empty tallboy for a bright drink that had its rim dusted with Tajin. &ldquo;Your top-shelf margarita, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Danny smiled demurely, &ldquo;Why thank you, sir.&rdquo; He very crudely ran his tongue along the rim and took a sip. He nearly melted into his drink, &ldquo;Wow, yeah. Thank you. This is great!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Eli leaned over the counter, putting his back to Emory and the rest of the group. &ldquo;How are you feeling? Long day?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What makes you say that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Eli figured it smart to not mention the dark, heavy bags under his eyes. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re not as chatty as usual.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, pardon me,&rdquo; Danny scoffed, nearly choking on his drink. &ldquo;Hard to be chatty when Emory&rsquo;s around.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just checking in, is all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve just about had enough of that today, no offense.&rdquo; A light buzz replaced his usual impulse control. &ldquo;Kinda tired of everyone treating me like I&rsquo;m a bomb that&rsquo;s gonna go off.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got a lot of people that care about you. I don&rsquo;t think anyone thinks you&rsquo;re a bomb.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you know, here&rsquo;s the thing, Eli. I am. I <em>am</em> a bomb, plain and simple. I just don&rsquo;t like being treated like it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can we use a different word, please? I don&rsquo;t want security getting called over here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hm, I feel like a, uh&hellip;powder keg?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not sure that&rsquo;s much better.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He pursed his lips as he took a long sip. &ldquo;A liability?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now that&rsquo;s just depressing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, then I dunno what to tell ya&rsquo;,&rdquo; he slumped over the counter with a sigh. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m just a depressing guy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re definitely hamming it up a little,&rdquo; Eli gave his shoulder a nudge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was really hoping drinks would light me up a bit, but&hellip;&rdquo; he trailed off. His shoulders felt heavy and the noise of the bar had all blended into a loud static. He wanted to sit up and entertain, crack jokes, ask how Eli had been. He was more than aware of his depressing demeanor, what with how a grown adult was slumped across the bar with his face smushed against the sticky countertop. He half expected Eli to have let him be after the long pause. He so desperately tried to muster the energy that everyone wanted him to have and that he knew he was supposed to. But. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m just really tired.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To his surprise, he felt a warm, gentle hand on his shoulder. He peeked up to see Eli right where he had been.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; Eli began softly. &ldquo;I hope you&rsquo;re able to get some rest soon. Like, actual, fulfilling rest.&rdquo; His kind smile warped into a sarcastic smirk. &ldquo;Not just rotting in bed watching cooking videos.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Danny straightened with an offended scoff. &ldquo;Excuse me, those cooking videos taught me how to make those croissants you like so much.&rdquo; He wiggled his shoulders proudly. &ldquo;I also watch cat videos like every other depressed millennial.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, my mistake.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hey, Eli!&rdquo; Emory reached across Gen to slap him on the arm, causing both he and Danny to flinch. &ldquo;Got any insider knowledge about all these rogue Branches lately?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Danny let out a protesting groan. &ldquo;Dammit, Emory, no more Vice stuff, <em>please</em>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m allowed to talk to him, too. You don&rsquo;t get to hog him all night.&rdquo; Emory pushed Rami&rsquo;s interjecting hand away and continued, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not asking for specifics! We don&rsquo;t have to get technical.&rdquo; They raised their hands defensively. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m just wondering: is this &lsquo;anomaly&rsquo; here to stay for a while? Because it&rsquo;s kind of becoming a thing. Is CVRS pouring a lot of resources into this, or did they just send you out with a script of bullshit to say for optics?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gen and Rami exchanged a series of glances on par with an entire conversation while Eli hemmed and hawed for an acceptable reply. &ldquo;Sorry, Emory,&rdquo; he rubbed his neck with a sigh. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m off the clock, so I can&rsquo;t discuss.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Emory rolled their eyes as Gen and Rami nodded in approval.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, whether CVRS recognizes it or not, I&rsquo;m convinced this is a thing. Dunno what kind of thing yet, but it&rsquo;s something.&rdquo; They tossed back the rest of their cocktail and clinked their empty glass against the counter. &ldquo;And if this really turns out to <em>be</em> a thing, CVRS is making a huge mistake. They&rsquo;re gonna look awfully stupid when some rando off the street blows this whole thing wide open while they sat with their thumbs up their asses.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be sure to let Mr. CVRS himself know.&rdquo; Eli offered a tight-lipped smile. &ldquo;But in all honesty, Emory. If you find anything out of the ordinary, please let us know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They rose to their feet and shoved a stern, demanding finger in his face. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t piss me off with that friendly corporate bullshit, Eli. I&rsquo;ll bring out the broken beer bottle again if I need to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Already threw Danny&rsquo;s away, sorry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dammit!&rdquo; They cartoonishly snapped their finger in defeat and returned to their seat with a pleasant smile. &ldquo;Anyway, the whiskey sour was great. I could do another round if y&rsquo;all are up for it. Whiskey helps me sleep better. Gotta be rested for my new route tomorrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rami rubbed the bridge of his nose, telling Eli and Danny that he had supposedly spent the last 10 minutes trying to dissuade Emory from their plans. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care if you hang out at the convenience store all day, but you <em>have</em> to leave Danny and Lawrence alone. No more sniffling floor tiles, <em>please</em>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll leave them alone, but I&rsquo;ll sniff as many floor tiles as I have to to get to the bottom of this.&rdquo; Emory pushed their empty glass toward Eli. &ldquo;And I <em>will</em> figure it out. Whatever <em>it</em> is. I can feel it in my bones, Rami. There&rsquo;s something going on here.&rdquo;</p>
