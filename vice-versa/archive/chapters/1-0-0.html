        <h1><span class="superhead">1.0.0</span>Suspend</h1>
        <p>It was a calm Tuesday evening at the corner store, and Danny&rsquo;s shift had been relatively uneventful, much to his blood pressure&rsquo;s delight. As boring as it was, he knew to be careful what he wished for. The last time he had yearned for a little excitement, the street was full of uniformed agents in blacked-out vans, so he resigned himself to the monotony, kicked back, and watched the riveting security camera feed.</p>
        <p>The cameras showed a lone customer ambling to the back wall of drinks. They were the only other person in the store besides Danny and his boss, Lawrence, who was cooling down after he worked himself into a frenzy from a vendor cancelling their contract.</p>
        <p>The customer strolled past each display, as if they were intently studying the chilled drinks behind the glass doors. They couldn&rsquo;t seem to make up their mind, aimlessly sauntering up and down the aisle with no sign of preference, their gait slowing as time ticked by. The customer had come to a complete stop in the middle of the aisle, still no drinks in hand. Danny drew in a deep breath as his eyes grew heavy. Perhaps a small bit of excitement was too much to ask for at 8 p.m. on a Tuesday.</p>
        <p>The front door suddenly flew open, causing Danny to scramble upright in surprise as the electronic <em>ding-dong</em> of the chime rang in the air. A flash of deep, fiery red locks blew past the threshold and a petite, scruffy character in a large, olive utility jacket approached Danny at the counter.</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Well, well, well!&rdquo; they exclaimed, pushing the orange-tinted goggles up their forehead to reveal bright, lively brown eyes. &ldquo;What are the odds you&rsquo;re at one of my sites again?&rdquo;</p>
        <p>Danny muttered an acknowledging &ldquo;Emory,&rdquo; with a nod, then slumped over the counter with a long drawn-out sigh. He figured that was what he deserved for secretly wishing for a bit of action. Emory was certainly the epitome of such, a whirlwind of unbridled chaos and obscenity. He looked up from his phone with raised brows. &ldquo;Did the wretched vibes summon you again?&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Simply speaking, yes, but I don&rsquo;t like your tone,&rdquo; they sniffed indignantly.</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Dunno where the hell you think they&rsquo;re coming from. It&rsquo;s not exactly busy tonight.&rdquo; He looked up and gestured to the near-empty store.</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Just because you&rsquo;re not busy doesn&rsquo;t mean something&rsquo;s not happening around here. This is a big building. Could be the pawn shop next door or one of the apartments upstairs. Including yours. Don&rsquo;t you find it a little odd I got called here again?&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;<em>Called?</em> By who? The vibes?&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Gh&ndash;yes, the <em>vibes</em>, jackass,&rdquo; they snarled.</p>
        <p>Danny failed to suppress a taunting grin. &ldquo;You could get in a lot of trouble, you know. You&rsquo;re lucky I haven&rsquo;t reported you yet.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Oh, like you of all people give a damn. What would you even report me for?&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Impersonating a CVRS Target Hunter.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>They blew a dismissive raspberry and rolled their eyes. &ldquo;S&rsquo;not like I&rsquo;m running around with a fake badge or anything.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Rami&rsquo;s told you he could get you a job with CVRS. They&rsquo;re understaffed anyway, so they&rsquo;re probably desperate. I don&rsquo;t understand why you don&rsquo;t just do the bootcamp and get certified. You&rsquo;d get paid much better than the wimpy stipends they give out for civilian intervention.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not about the money,&rdquo; they turned their head with an irritated huff.</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Well good, because it&rsquo;s not like CVRS pays a ton anyways. Either way, Rami said to cut it out. It&rsquo;d be a shame if he found out you were still running around doing all this after y&rsquo;all&rsquo;s last spat. You wouldn&rsquo;t want him to be disappointed in you.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>Emory&rsquo;s face fell into a scowl. &ldquo;How dare you make me even think of such a thing. And what, are you gonna tell on me? Thought you didn&rsquo;t care about this stuff. What good does tattling do for you?&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;d cut down on your impromptu visits, that&rsquo;s for sure.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re not <em>impromptu</em>. There&rsquo;s an art to this; I&rsquo;ve told you a million times. Regardless, this is the sixth call to this site in the last three months, so something&rsquo;s definitely up. It&rsquo;s not like I&rsquo;m hanging around here because of your stellar personality.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>Danny whipped out his phone with an unamused sniff. &ldquo;Hurry up and do your thing. I&rsquo;m done talking about this.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Y&rsquo;know, the longer I talk to you, the more I wonder if the bad vibes <em>are</em> just coming from you,&rdquo; Emory muttered as they picked through their deep jacket pockets.</p>
        <p>He offered a lightly offended grunt. &ldquo;What makes you think you&rsquo;re even in the right place?&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Like I&rsquo;ve always said, kinda got a sixth sense for these things. And these goggles I found in the dumpster behind CVRS help me out, even if they&rsquo;re a bit cracked.&rdquo; They pulled them back down, tinting their vision with a deep amber. Small clusters of fuzzy white light and individual pinholes of light hung in the air around them, unfettered by their movements. Small, faint tendrils sat atop Emory&rsquo;s shoulder blades while a single column ran the height of Danny&rsquo;s spine. Emory looked around them, then confidently planted their hands on their hips with a decisive nod. &ldquo;Yep. Seems to be a lot of&hellip;whatever it is these goggles see.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Positive ions,&rdquo; Danny grumbled.</p>
        <p>&ldquo;For someone who doesn&rsquo;t like this stuff, you sure know a lot. Or are you just saying whatever so I&rsquo;ll leave.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I suppose you&rsquo;ll never know.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; Emory puffed out their chest, &ldquo;Believe me or don&rsquo;t, but something&rsquo;s definitely off here, somewhere around here, maybe even in this building.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>He returned to his phone with an amused scoff. &ldquo;You should talk to Lawrence. We&rsquo;ve been talking about things being off for like three months now. He started putting salt in the door a few weeks ago. He&rsquo;s convinced it&rsquo;s a string of bad luck.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Why&rsquo;s he think that?&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Well, I mean you see it, right?&rdquo; Danny gestured to the near-empty store. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got next to no customers, people are&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Maybe it&rsquo;s the smell.&rdquo; Emory sniffed at the stale, chemical odor hanging in the air. &ldquo;Y&rsquo;all could at least put out some air fresheners.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Nah, we were loosing customers before we got that smell. It&rsquo;s not just the customers, people are quitting left and right. I&rsquo;m practically the only one who comes in anymore, and the only people left on our roster have been out on unpaid sick leave for weeks. A couple vendors even cancelled their contracts with the store. Hard not to feel like a string of bad luck, at least from Lawrence&rsquo;s point of view.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Well, I dunno what he thinks salt&rsquo;s gonna do.&rdquo; They pulled out a pair of tattered fingerless gloves from their jacket pocket. They were a dense, solid black through Emory&rsquo;s tinted lenses. &ldquo;And what do you think?&rdquo;</p>
        <p>He offered a nonchalant shrug with a light scoff. &ldquo;Eh, I think shit just happens sometimes. Life&rsquo;s unfair. Feels kinda silly to blame it on bad luck when things aren&rsquo;t going your way. I don&rsquo;t blame him for thinking that, though. Easier to deal with it all when you&rsquo;ve got something to blame, I think. Even if it&rsquo;s just luck.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s bad luck <em>or</em> life just being cruel.&rdquo; Emory continued. &ldquo;Anything else come to mind?&rdquo; They waggled their eyebrows suggestively as he rolled his eyes with an objecting click of his teeth. &ldquo;Hey, you can&rsquo;t deny that five initiated Branches in three months is a little suspicious. Six if this call doesn&rsquo;t end up being a dud.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>Danny eyed the frayed, unfinished edges of their gloves. They were likely a decade old at this point and had also been found in a CVRS dumpster, unsurprisingly. &ldquo;Still can&rsquo;t believe you&rsquo;re running around doing this without a license.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;License-schmicense. Didn&rsquo;t realize you were such a CVRS bootlicker,&rdquo; they grumbled as they struggled to tear off a fraying thread. &ldquo;Is Lawrence in? I think I might do a lap and see&ndash;&rdquo; They suddenly paused, straightening in surprise. &ldquo;Oh shit, wait. Do you smell that?&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Okay, I get it, I&rsquo;ll put out an air freshener t&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;No, no, it&rsquo;s something new. Chlorine, maybe? Reminds me of the public pool.&rdquo; Emory held up a quieting finger and continued in a hushed tone, &ldquo;You really don&rsquo;t smell that?&rdquo;</p>
        <p>He instinctively hunched his shoulders and leaned toward them, surprised by their seriousness. &ldquo;Not really. Why are we whispering?&rdquo; he whispered back.</p>
        <p>He stumbled forward and caught himself on the counter.</p>
        <p>Emory looked up at him, a spark igniting in their eyes. &ldquo;Oh! Did you feel something? Is it a Branch?&rdquo; A gentle tug at the heels of their combat boots verified their assumption and they pounded their fists together with fiery conviction. &ldquo;Oh, hell yeah. I knew I was in the right place!&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;E-Emory, seriously?&rdquo; he stammered, trying to ignore the magnetic pull pressing him against the counter. He looked past them to meet the eyes of the customer at the back of the store, their head limply thrown over their shoulder, their pupils wide and face gaunt. He looked back at Emory with wide, terrified eyes as he stammered out, &ldquo;A-a-are you sure you should be doing this?&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m <em>so</em> sure.&rdquo; Emory jauntily spun on their heel and locked eyes with the Host, flashing an exhilarated grin.</p>
        <p>The Host&rsquo;s chest hitched erratically as they mouthed an inaudible plea, the sound of liquid gurgling in their throat. Danny swallowed dryly, unable to pull his eyes away.</p>
        <p>Emory flipped a tuft of hair behind their shoulder and confidently looked back at Danny. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got this down to a minute. Time me.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>They drove their heel into the tile, and a bright flash of light pulsed from their bandaged knee, shooting a beam into the air above them. It expanded and morphed into a baseball bat in a burst of bright cyan. The details were soft, and its form was fluid, but it was undeniably a baseball bat, transparent, pulsing, and glowing.</p>
        <p>They tightened their hands around the grip with a confidence born from repeated practice. Beads of bright cyan warped around their palms, and small beams of light shot from between their fingers. They threw their bat over their shoulder and bolted down the aisle with an unwavering conviction that Danny almost envied. Almost.</p>
        <p>He tried to ignore the tightening lump in his throat, but the magnetic pull of a Branch Staging was one that rivaled the morbid fascination of watching a train wreck. It was practically impossible to look away, no matter how disgusted he was. The last thing he wanted to see was Emory&rsquo;s Suspension tactics in action, but he was forced to watch, fearfully gripping the countertop as if he were going to be pulled right in.</p>
        <p>Emory lunged toward the Host, their eyes wide with a wild frenzy. Danny's jaw clenched as the pulsing barrel smashed against the Host&rsquo;s cheek in a brilliant burst of cyan particles. They stumbled back, clattering against the glass doors as they uttered a breathless groan. Emory drove the top of the bat into the Host&rsquo;s gut, and a wet, miserable cough made Danny&rsquo;s stomach churn as a clear, off-white sludge sputtered from their lips.</p>
        <p>One more swing was all it took for the Host to fall to the ground in a shallow puddle of the translucent goop oozing from their slack lips and unresponsive eyes. Emory raised a victorious fist, pumping their bat into the air before it warped out of sight in a bright flash of sparkling light. &ldquo;Danny! How long was that?&rdquo;</p>
        <p>He cautiously emerged from behind the counter, no longer feeling the tug on his heels. &ldquo;I-I don&rsquo;t know. I wasn&rsquo;t timing.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Gah, I told you to time me! I&rsquo;m getting really good at this!&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Clearly,&rdquo; he muttered as he approached the person lying unconscious in a puddle of what appeared to be&mdash;and smelled like&mdash;bleach. &ldquo;The magical bat seems a tad overkill. Do you really even need it if you&rsquo;re just going to knock them out? Why not just use your fists?&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Listen, I earned this Patch. It&rsquo;s only fair that I use it for its intended purpose. Plus, most of &lsquo;em don&rsquo;t put up much of a fight when I whip that bad boy out. Don&rsquo;t wanna risk things getting outta hand or accidentally getting pulled in as an adjunct, so I like to play it safe.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>It was getting hard to ignore the overwhelming odor assaulting his nostrils. The scene reeked of bleach as the fluid seemed to dissipate into thin air, the pungent fumes warping the drink shelves behind them. Danny pulled his collar up over his nose. &ldquo;Sure we should be inhaling this stuff?&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Ah, it ain&rsquo;t gonna hurtchya. I don&rsquo;t think. Not any more than huffing bleach in your bathroom would, if I had to guess.&rdquo; They planted their hands on their hips and gestured toward the person with a nod. &ldquo;Well? You gonna help me?&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Help you with what?&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I only Suspended it. Help me get them to Urgent Care so CVRS can take care of it.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d really rather not.&rdquo; He grimaced as he tightened his arms around his uneasy stomach. &ldquo;You know I can&rsquo;t stand this stuff. I think I&rsquo;ve had my share for tonight. Or a month. Or two.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Ah, yeah? Would you rather me leave &lsquo;em here for it to come back?&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;What&ndash;can&rsquo;t you just&hellip;&rdquo; He wiggled his fingers vaguely, &ldquo;...properly get rid of it?&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Like I said, I Suspended it. The Branch isn&rsquo;t active anymore and even if it was, I can&rsquo;t Commit it; I don&rsquo;t know anything about their Vice! That would be dangerous!&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Oh, and assaulting them into unconsciousness with a magical baseball bat isn&rsquo;t?&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Yeah, just makes &lsquo;em pass out and the little Vice stops trying to take over their body. If I&rsquo;m not prepared for a Branch and I try to Commit one, they could die! I could die! You could die! I thought you knew a lot about Vices!&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Gah&ndash;quit! Stop! Just take your Suspended Host and get out of here, please!&rdquo;</p>
        <p>Emory flipped their hair with a scoff. &ldquo;Not even a thank you? I didn&rsquo;t have to do this, you know.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;You probably shouldn&rsquo;t have! I still don&rsquo;t understand why you don&rsquo;t leave it to the professionals!&rdquo;</p>
        <p>They threw out their arms and gestured theatrically at the empty store around them. &ldquo;See any professionals? I Suspend the Branches the professionals don&rsquo;t know about. That&rsquo;s my whole schtick! If I hadn&rsquo;t been here, this could&rsquo;ve gotten real ugly real quick. And if you don&rsquo;t help me, you&rsquo;re gonna see just how ugly things can get.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d hate to see what you consider ugly,&rdquo; Danny scrunched his nose as he stepped back from the seeping puddle of hissing goo. &ldquo;Fine. What do I need to do?&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Just&hellip;you know,&rdquo; Emory gestured to the body. &ldquo;Get &lsquo;em outta here. Firefighter style, bridal style, whatever you fancy. Just don&rsquo;t drag &lsquo;em. Did that once and got the cops called on me.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>He bent down and inspected the puddle of goo with a wrinkled nose. &ldquo;You sure this stuff&rsquo;s okay to touch?&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s just bleach, man. Grab some gloves and get over it.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;You know I took this job to avoid this kind of stuff, right?&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Well, jokes on you. Seems like there&rsquo;s something about this building that the Vices like. Maybe it&rsquo;s the hot chips.&rdquo; They grabbed a bag from the endcap. &ldquo;These are hard to find, you know.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Another one?&rdquo; Kieran, the Intake Coordinator, peered over her computer screen and sighed at the dripping, unresponsive body draped across Danny&rsquo;s shoulders, loosely bundled in dingy white towels and supported by Danny&rsquo;s hands, sporting pink rubber gloves. She adjusted orange-tinted bifocals on the bridge of her nose as she quickly scanned the body and began typing her observations into the system. She deliberately paused her typing to shoot Emory a stern look before she entered their contact information into the system, now having it memorized.</p>
        <p>&ldquo;The Floor Manager will be here to initiate intake shortly. In the meantime&hellip;&rdquo; She flipped her glasses down and raised her brows, &ldquo;...how in the world do you keep finding these?&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Just got a knack for it, I guess,&rdquo; Emory proudly adjusted their jacket. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re making it easy on me, though. This one was at that same corner store down the street again.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Interesting&hellip;&rdquo; she hummed as she typed a couple notes, glancing at Danny. &ldquo;Another Suspension, I presume?&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Same ol&rsquo;, same ol&rsquo;. They didn&rsquo;t put up much of a fight, so I didn&rsquo;t get a chance to see any blights outside of the bleach coming outta them. As I&rsquo;m sure you can smell.&rdquo; Emory restlessly tapped their fingers on the counter. &ldquo;Is Rami running the floor tonight?&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;He is. And if I remember correctly, he told you to stop playing Target Hunter.&rdquo; She paused her typing to glance up at Emory. &ldquo;Correct?&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;And? You ever seen Rami scold somebody? Successfully, I mean. He&rsquo;s got the backbone of an overcooked spaghetti noodle.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>She smiled gently as the doors exuberantly flew open beside her. In walked a large, charismatic man with a charmingly fluffy beard and dazzling smile. His white lab coat fluttered behind him as he quickly approached the counter, carrying a welcomed wave of bergamont with him.</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Emory!&rdquo; he threw his hands up with an amused scoff. &ldquo;Again? What did I tell y&ndash;a-and Danny? Why is the, uh&hellip;why are you&mdash;of all people&mdash;carrying the patient?&rdquo;</p>
        <p>Danny adjusted the patient with a grunt. &ldquo;Speaking of, can you please take them? My knee&rsquo;s about to lock up.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Right, right. Come on back!&rdquo; He opened the doors and ushered them to follow. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re packed, but I&rsquo;ve got my Triage Specialists helping out. I can take care of y&rsquo;all really quick.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>Emory gave Danny a couple convincing shoves, and he stumbled forward hesitantly. &ldquo;I-I&rsquo;d really rather n&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;ll be quick! Just set &lsquo;em down right here,&rdquo; Rami gestured to the hospital bed as he began flipping through a clipboard. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll just need you to fill out a report, and&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;O-oh, no. No need to do that. I just carried the body. Emory handled it. They can fill out the report.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s still protocol to gather reports from any available witnesses. It&rsquo;ll only take a few minutes. Unless you got pulled in as adjuncts. Then we might be here a while. But if I know Emory&rsquo;s methods at all&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
        <p>Emory yanked the clipboard and pen from his hands. &ldquo;Just a Suspension. He&rsquo;d better not be getting a cut of my stipend.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Yeah, wouldn&rsquo;t wanna get in between Emory and their money.&rdquo; Danny awkwardly sloughed the patient from his shoulders and they stumbled onto the bed with a lifeless thud. &ldquo;I really just wanna get out of here. I did my good deed for the day.&rdquo; He peeled off the gloves and sighed at the bleach stains across his shoulders. Without the bleach-covered Host dominating his nostrils, he could smell the trademark CVRS fragrance: alcohol swabs. A familiar uneasiness began to churn deep in his stomach.</p>
        <p>Rami relented with a polite sigh. &ldquo;Fine. I know you don&rsquo;t like this stuff, but you missed work for this, right? I&rsquo;ll fill it out for you so you get a stipend. Feel free to wait outside. It&rsquo;ll only be a minute.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Why&rsquo;s he getting a stipend? I did all the work!&rdquo; Danny could hear Emory cry as he quickly turned on his heel and sped for the door.</p>
        <p>Rami retorted, &ldquo;Is that why you keep doing this? This isn&rsquo;t financially sustainable at all! You&rsquo;d make much more as an official Target Hunter than you&rsquo;ll ever get collecting stipends!&rdquo;</p>
        <p>Their budding argument faded as Danny made a bee-line for the exit. He gave Kieran a cordial nod as he stepped outside and took a deep inhale.</p>
        <p>His shoulders slumped with a dramatic exhale as he clumsily bent down to take a seat on the curb. His nausea was catching up with him and as much as he would&rsquo;ve preferred to head home&mdash;the stipend wasn&rsquo;t nearly enough to convince him to stay&mdash;he was afraid any more steps would have urged a very convincing gag.</p>
        <p>The stinging scent of rubbing alcohol still lingered in his nostrils, and he dragged his hands down his face with an exhausted groan. Just the slightest whiff was able to launch his parasympathetic nervous system into survival mode. He inhaled deeply, hoping the breaths of not-so-fresh city air were enough to fend off the oncoming nausea spell.</p>
        <p>There wasn&rsquo;t much that could help anymore, short of spending the rest of his day swaddled under a pile of 3 blankets, minimum. Ironically enough, the alcohol swabs that had been originally used to sooth his perpetually uneasy stomach as a child were now one of the worst offenders. The nurses claimed the scent was strong enough to distract the brain and interrupt the budding nausea, but it only worked for him the first couple of times.</p>
        <p>He had gotten particularly skilled at warding off these episodes, but only if he had the luxury of being under his covers. Just three nights ago, he was able to prevent an episode by distracting himself with cooking videos, soft blankets, and sweet, musky candles. So long as he was at home, he could get ahead of it and prevent it from spiraling into something unmanageable. But as it turned out, he wasn&rsquo;t home, and even though the humid Texas air was akin to a blanket, it just wasn&rsquo;t cutting it.</p>
        <p>Rami poked his head out of the door and called out, &ldquo;Danny! I&rsquo;ve got your&mdash;o-oh no.&rdquo; His shoulders withered with pity as he watched Danny brace himself over a trashcan and heave his stomach contents into the bin. &ldquo;Y-you good? Do I need to check you in?&rdquo;</p>
        <p>Danny offered a dismissive wave before returning to the bin to continue his compulsive retching.</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Well, once you&rsquo;re done I&rsquo;ve got your stipend. Don&rsquo;t tell Emory.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Like I&rsquo;m not right here.&rdquo; Emory shoved their way out the door. &ldquo;I thought I convinced you he shouldn&rsquo;t get one!&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re gonna look at this pathetic wet-paper-towel-of-a-man and deny him even just a little stipend for helping out tonight? Poor guy could&rsquo;ve just gone home and watched his cooking shows and now he&rsquo;s barfing in a public trash can because you looped him into your shenanigans.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t loop him into anything! Like I said, the Branch just so happened to have been at the store. Again! And if I hadn&rsquo;t done anything, he and the Host would&rsquo;ve been dead!&rdquo;</p>
        <p>Rami rolled his eyes. &ldquo;Oh, come on. Like I said, it was an adolescent Alpha Vice throwing a little fit. The odds of the Host turning comatose, let alone berserk are practically zero. The Host is with our the Intake Manager right now and will probably be discharged in a couple hours. It&rsquo;s not like you prevented a mass Epsilon or Omega Branch.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>Danny&rsquo;s retching grew louder as they continued their jargon-filled bickering, and eventually urged Emory to throw their head over their shoulder with a scowl. &ldquo;<em>God</em>, you&rsquo;re dramatic!&rdquo;</p>
        <p>He whipped his head up and returned a scowl of his own, but he was unable to retort. A viscous, tar-like sludge dripped from his chin, causing Rami to defensively grip his clipboard to his chest. &ldquo;Danny, you sure you don&rsquo;t want me to check you in? Gen&rsquo;s still here and could get you some Suppressants to&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d literally rather&mdash;&rdquo; he punctuated his response with a final heave over the bin. He straightened and wiped his chin on his sleeve, the black tar sizzling into a fine mist. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going home.&rdquo;</p>
