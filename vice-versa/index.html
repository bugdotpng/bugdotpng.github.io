        <h1>Vice Versa</h1>
        <p>Danny is a depressed gas station cashier who truly, despite the cliche nature of it, just wants to live a normal life. But in a world infested with creatures called "Vices", this is far from a simple thing to achieve&mdash;especially when he has one of his own.</p>
        <p>With the help of his good friends Gen and Rami, he has learned how to lead a relatively uneventful life, but the growing feeling of unease has been getting harder to ignore. And when the raging spitfire Emory becomes a more sustained force in his life, he can feel himself on the edge of a breakdown.</p>
        <p>But, as Danny would say if he liked to give pithy aphorisms, you can't make an omelete without breaking a few eggs.</p>
