                        <p>Agents in Urgent Care provide acute care and treat at-risk patients from both Primary Care and Public Deployment, as well as public admissions. Urgent Care is trained to commit threatening Branches and refer patients back to Primary Care to resume or begin treatment.</p>

                        <p>Agents in Public Deployment are on-call 24/7, often patrolling high-traffic hot spots, led by their resident Target Hunter. These agents respond to public Branches or can be requested to monitor a potential threat. These agents also address post-Branch cleanup to ensure no anomalies have occurred.</p>

                        </div>
                        <p>The Aggregation team primarily curates, sorts, and prioritizes information submitted by the Observation team and agents from Public Health & Safety who are in active Branches. These agents parse large amounts of data to find patterns and changes in Vice behavior and biology.</p>

                        </div>
                        <p>Observation is a unique team of pseudo Adjuncts who accompany both the Primary and Urgent Care teams in Branches of all types, from standard to rogue to instigated. These agents do not interfere with or have an impact on active  Branches and send their observations to Aggregation for review.</p>

                        </div>
                        <p>Integral to agents’ success, both sectors have a Sector Advocate. These agents do not engage with patients or facilitate research; instead, they perform the administrative duties for the agents of their respective sector, including hiring, employee relations, and funding requests.</p>
