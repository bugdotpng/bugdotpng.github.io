                        </div>
                        <p>Discover the roles and responsibilities of the agents you are likely to meet throughout your Vice journey. Whether they’re patient-focused or conducting research, our agents are passionate about making a difference.</p>

                <div class="main-content">
                    <h2>Training Tiers</h2>
                    <p>As an agent, you will need to complete a specific tier of training in order to be onboarded. Familiarize yourself with the training requirements of your desired position below.</p>
                    <h3 class="has-label">Basic Training <span class="label">6 Months</span></h3>
                    <p>Basic Training gives a high-level overview of Vice anatomy, physiology, and psychology, ensuring agents have a firm foundation in Vice fundamentals. During this time, agents learn about the properties of Branches and common Branch formulae and practice decision-making skills in a high-stress environment.</p>
                    <p>All agents, in a sense, must complete Basic Training, as the information learned in this course will guide you no matter your role, whether that’s face-to-face with patients or behind the scenes with research. In order to complete Basic Training, you must pass a written exam.</p>
                    <p>Agents expected to pass Basic Training are as follows:</p>
                    <ul class="two-col">
                        <li>Record Proctor</li>
                        <li>Intake Coordinator</li>
                        <li>Lead Station Aggregator</li>
                        <li>Forecast Specialist</li>
                        <li>Intake Coordinator</li>
                        <li>Report Coordinator</li>
                        <li>Research Proctor</li>
                        <li>Technician</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h3 class="has-label">Basic+ Training <span class="label">8 Months</span></h3>
                    <p>A direct extension of Basic Training, Basic+ expands on Branch fundamentals, specifically to train agents who will be brought in as pseudo Adjuncts. In addition to passing the initial written exam at 6 months, agents must then pass a subsequent oral exam focused on Branch fundamentals.</p>
                    <p>Agents expected to pass Basic+ Training are as follows:</p>
                    <ul class="two-col">
                        <li>Solutions Architect</li>
                        <li>Branch Proctor</li>
                        <li>Vice Analyst</li>
                        <li>Branch Analyst</li>
                        <li>Behavioral Analyst</li>
                        <li>Exposure Analyst</li>
                        <li>Product Engineer</li>
                        <li>Textile Engineer</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h3 class="has-label">Suspension Training <span class="label">1 Year</span></h3>
                    <p>Because these agents are expected to make regular direct contact with patients, agents practice speed and efficiency in making decisions under pressure and learn to recognize the warning signs of Branches. Suspension is the act of terminating a Branch during staging, granting the patient more time to gather the resources needed to properly address the Branch.</p>
                    <p>Many of these agents are likely to be around high-risk patients during their career, and learning to recognize a Branch being staged ensures the safety of the patient and those around them.</p>
                    <p>The agent must successfully suspend a Branch in order to receive certification, in addition to passing the written and oral exams of the previous training levels.</p>
                    <p>Agents expected to pass Suspension Training are as follows:</p>
                    <ul class="two-col">
                        <li>Branch Recovery Specialist</li>
                        <li>Blight Specialist</li>
                        <li>AV Specialist</li>
                        <li>Traffic Coordinator</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h3 class="has-label">Commit Training <span class="label">18 Months</span></h3>
                    <p>At the beginning of Commit Training, agents are brought in to Branches as pseudo Adjuncts to observe real-life cases addressed by professionals. During this time, agents learn efficient patch-summoning and wielding techniques, practice decision-making during high-stakes situations, and learn to find patterns in a patient’s Branch Policy.</p>
                    <p>After an agent demonstrates understanding as a pseudo Adjunct, they will begin to be brought in as a secondary Adjunct alongside a primary Adjunct, typically a Vice Management Administrator or Branch Admin. Commit Training is considerably more rigorous compared to Suspension Training, as agents are expected to familiarize themselves with both the local and master research databases.</p>
                    <p>Agents must successfully commit a Branch as a secondary Adjunct in order to receive certification, in addition to passing the written, oral, and psychological exams of the previous training levels.</p>
                    <p>Agents expected to pass Commit Training are as follows:</p>
                    <ul class="two-col">
                        <li>Target Hunter</li>
                        <li>Vice Management Coordinator</li>
                        <li>Floor Manager</li>
                        <li>Branch Coordinator</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h3 class="has-label">Rescission Training <span class="label">2 Years</span></h3>
                    <p>The most rigorous of the Branch training, Rescission Training requires agents to routinely commit Branches by shadowing agents currently working with patients. Agents at this level should also be comfortable committing Branches by themselves. Most agents with this degree of training do not suspend Branches unless a commit would threaten the safety of the patient.</p>
                    <p>In addition to shadowing, and when traffic to stations are low, agents must also adhere to a rigid training schedule that ensures efficient patch wielding and decision-making.</p>
                    <p>An agent must successfully rescind a Vice as a secondary or primary Adjunct and pass the written, oral, and psychological exams of the previous training levels in order to become certified. If an agent is unable to rescind a Vice in the time allotted, they are enrolled in a new round of Rescission Training, which typically spans 6 months.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Branch Administrator</li>
                        <li>Vice Management Administrator</li>
                    </ul>
                    <hr/>
                    <h2>Continuing Education</h2>
                    <p>After an agent has passed their respective training, they will be expected to stay up to date with research findings, learn any cutting-edge technology that has been introduced to their gear kit, and keep their skills sharp. As part of your role, CVRS will conduct regular on-the-job trainings to ensure you meet these requirements.</p>
                    <h3 class="has-label">Role Refresher <span class="label">Bi-Annual</span></h3>
                    <p>Mandatory Role Refreshers are held twice a year, one in January and the other in July. No matter the role, these trainings are mandatory. Agents are made aware of the date three months in advance. Role Refreshers typically span one week, each day dedicated to a different team. Depending on the team, Role Refreshers can be structure like a conference or as hands-on demonstrations. Agents only need to attend their respective training. If agents are interested in pursuing a career on another team, they are allowed to attend but must take PTO.</p>
                    <h3 class="has-label">New Tech Training <span class="label">As-Needed</span></h3>
                    <p>CVRS is always introducing new technology to our agents’ gear kits. As existing technology gets upgrades or completely new technology is introduced, we are committed to ensuring our agents understand how to efficiently and expertly wield this technology to best serve our patients.</p>
                    <h3 class="has-label">Research Enhancements <span class="label">As-Needed</span></h3>
                    <p>As the field of vicology expands and Vices continue to evolve, our research team is dedicated to facilitating up-to-date research to unravel the mysteries of Vices. As the research team makes new discoveries, the Research Proctor will present this information in a day-long or half-day seminar based on the complexity of the findings. Minor and patch updates to the VRC typically take a half-day, while major updates require the full day.</p>
                    <p>Agents unable to attend will be able to review recordings of the seminar and have access to the VRC changelog. Updates to the VRC will be made at the time of the presentation.</p>
                    <hr/>
                    <h2>Failure to Pass</h2>
                    <p>Failure to complete the designated training during the allotted time will result in probation where the agent will have another chance to complete their training. If an agent is still unable to complete their training, they will be terminated and can re-apply after six months.</p>
