                    <h2>CVRS Technology</h2>
                    <p>An important part of any agent’s gear kit is the array of gadgets specially designed for agents to more efficiently perform their duties. Our proprietary technology is designed in-house by our Technology Engineers, while Gear Technicians maintain the software and perform maintenance.</p>
                    <p>Browse the list below to learn more about our technology:</p>
                    <ul class="link-list two-col">
                        <li><a href="#digidata">DigiData (Digital Database)</a></li>
                        <li><a href="#mobicomm">MobiComm (Mobile Communications)</a></li>

                    </ul>
                    <h3 id="digidata">DigiData (Digital Database)</h3>
                    <p>This information-packed tablet contains both the local and master research databases and is automatically updated to reflect the most recent findings as they are released from the Research Sector. These databases are searchable and support bookmarking and personal annotations. DigiData are great for refreshing the fundamentals, receiving timely research findings, and logging observations.</p>
                    <p>All agents are issued a DigiData at the start of their respective training courses.</p>
                    <h3 id="mobicomm">MobiComm (Mobile Communications)</h3>
                    <p>Similar in appearance and function to a pager, this communication tool allows agents to communicate with each other, request backup, and log findings. A unique shorthand communication style is used to send messages with a MobiComm, and an agent must pass a written exam in order to be issued this device as well as regularly pass recurring exams to stay up to date with the expanding vocabulary.</p>
                    <p>While agents can and do often use their MobiComm for daily communication, where our proprietary technology sets itself apart from a standard pager is in the Branch Arena. Agents are able to send communications to each other and log observations inside the arena, though if an agent chooses to communicate with someone outside of the metaphysical realm, there can be a delay of anywhere from 8 to 12 minutes of in-Branch time. Due to this delay, MobiComm have a built-in distress signal that reduces the delay to roughly 4 minutes of in-Branch time.</p>
                    <p>Many agents also use their MobiComm to log case-relevant observations inside the Branch Arena that are eventually reviewed by their local team of Report Coordinators and Forecast Specialists. Due to the unique nature of a pseudo Adjunct’s connection, they are able to log their observations in the corporeal realm, but an extreme shorthand is used to accommodate for the time difference. In the case of Solutions Architects--who need to communicate with Branch Administrators and other agents in the Branch Arena--this shorthand is crucial to agents receiving timely updates. Recipients in the Branch Arena are notified of an incoming communication as soon as the Solutions Architect begins constructing the message and will begin to receive small chunks of text in 30-second increments until the transmission is complete.</p>
                    <p>Upon completion of training, the following agents are given a MobiComm:</p>
                    <ul class="two-col">
                        <li>Branch Administrator</li>
                        <li>Branch Coordinator</li>

                        <li>Technology Engineer</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h3 id="bypass">Bypass</h3>
                    <p>This device allows an agent to force their way into an active Branch as an Adjunct, with a success rate of about 72%. Bypasses are similar in appearance to tasers and interact with the Vice’s network in one of two ways, depending on the intended action. While Bypasses are most commonly used to force entry into an active Branch, they can also be used to instigate a Branch.</p>
                    <p>A Vice’s network is comprised of hundreds of tracks, which are densely-packed collections of vitiumnexum (VN) that transport hormones and VG throughout the Host’s body. In their default state, VN are neutrally charged, but become positively charged once a Branch is initiated. A Bypass takes advantage of this by directing a line of positively-charged electricity toward any stray tracks in the network. If a Branch is active, the electricity creates a “bridge” of contact that allows the agent to enter the Branch without having been queued. If a Branch is not active, the jolt of positively-charged electricity triggers the VN to swap their charge, resulting in an initiated Branch.</p>
                    <p>These devices are often used in conjunction with <a href="#parsing-goggles">Parsing Goggles</a> to help scope out potential tracks. After certification, agents are provided a set of three and advised to use sparingly. A Bypass can be used up to six times before it loses its electrical charge. Request for new kits are subject to denial if the supervisor suspects abuse. More can be learned about this process in the <em>Vice Research Compendium</em> under <a href="#">Forcing Entry</a>.</p>
                    <p>Upon completion of training, the following agents are given a set of three Bypasses:</p>
                    <ul class="two-col">
                        <li>Branch Administrator</li>
                        <li>Branch Coordinator</li>
                        <li>Solutions Architect</li>
                        <li>Target Hunter</li>
                        <li>Vice Management Specialist</li>
                        <li>Vice Management Coordinator</li>
                        <li>Floor Manager</li>
                        <li>Research Proctor</li>
                        <li>Vice Analyst</li>
                        <li>Branch Analyst</li>
                        <li>Behavioral Analyst</li>
                        <li>Exposure Analyst</li>
                        <li>Technician</li>
                        <li>Technology Engineer</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h3 id="avcharge">AVCharge</h3>
                    <p>These AV-packed, flashbang-adjacent explosives are used for large-scale Branch cleanup after particularly gruesome suspensions. They quickly neutralize large concentrations of VG and perform most efficiently in a closed space, such as a small building or room. Only AV are discharged, and the explosion, while extremely bright and loud, does not harm the environment or those present, outside of temporary blinding and hearing loss. AVCharges should only be used in an open space after the area has been cleared of civilians, patients and personnel.</p>
                    <p>Upon completion of training, the following agents are given a set of six AVCharges:</p>
                    <ul class="two-col">
                        <li>Branch Administrator</li>
                        <li>Branch Coordinator</li>
                        <li>Branch Recovery Specialist</li>
                        <li>Target Hunter</li>
                        <li>Technician</li>
                        <li>Technology Engineer</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h3 id="vgmeter">VGMeter</h3>
                    <p>This handheld device has two small probes at the end that detect the levels of VG in the air. VG concentration is presented on a scale of 0 to 10, with 10 being so solid that they’re visible, opaque, and tangible. The standard reading for indoors is roughly 3.5, while outside tends to hover around 1.3; cause for concern begins around roughly 6/7 when the concentration becomes visible.</p>
                    <p>VGMeters are typically used in conjunction with Parsing Goggles, which initially visualize the VG,  while the VGMeter identifies concentration and severity.</p>
                    <p>Upon completion of training, the following agents are given a VGMeter.</p>
                    <ul class="two-col">
                        <li>Branch Administrator</li>
                        <li>Branch Coordinator</li>
                        <li>Branch Recovery Specialist</li>
                        <li>Target Hunter</li>
                        <li>Record Administrator</li>
                        <li>Blight Specialist</li>
                        <li>Technician</li>
                        <li>Technology Engineer</li>

                    <h2>CVRS Gear</h2>
                    <p>While every agent is expected to wear their designated uniform, some roles require additional gear that has been specially created to emit AV or parse VG. Designed by a team of Textile Engineers, these articles mimic traditional clothing many are familiar with, but are lined with our proprietary textile technology that either enhances an agent’s natural connection to their AV source or allows us to see previously hidden VG.</p>
                    <p>Browse the list below to learn more about our gear:</p>

                    <h3 id="parsing-goggles">Parsing Goggles</h3>
                    <p>These goggles have polarized, treated glass that allow agents to observe VG, a byproduct of Vices previous invisible to the human eye in small amounts. While this eyewear has branched out into multiple styles over the years, they are always recognizable by their trademark orange tint. This eyewear can be used to observe a Vice’s network and monitor VG density in the environment.</p>
                    <p>Parsing Goggles are often used in conjunction with a Backdoor to aid in locating stray tracks available for use. Please note that some Vices have unique characteristics that help their networks avoid detection, where a VGMeter may need to be used to monitor VG levels.</p>
                    <p>Parsing Goggles come in an array of styles to accommodate an agent’s role. The following styles are available as options for agents to choose from upon completion of the appropriate training:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>standard eyewear</strong><br/>prescription lenses and bifocals can be enhanced to include the coating found in CVRS-issued  eyewear; used especially by Primary Care and Observation agents</li>
                        <li><strong>sunglasses</strong><br/>used especially by Public Deployment to avoid doubling up eyewear</li>
                        <li><strong>safety glasses</strong><br/>styles range from standard eyewear with side-shields to single-lens wrap-arounds; used primarily by agents often brought into Branches as Adjuncts</li>
                        <li><strong>goggles</strong><br/>styles include both cup and cover goggles, many models drawing inspiration from lab equipment; used primarily by gents often brought into Branches as Adjunct</li>

                    <h3 id="summoning-gloves">Summoning Gloves</h3>
                    <p>These gloves allow for expedited patch summoning and aid in Branch cleanup thanks to their charged, AV-infused palms. Styles typically resemble sleek motorcycle gloves with a thick, textured lining on the palm, but they can vary to accommodate different patches and agent roles.</p>
                    <p>These gloves also improve an agent’s grip on a summoned patch and can bolster a patch’s makeup outside of a Branch where structural instabilities are common. Summoning Gloves should be brought back for recharging after repeated use.</p>
                    <p>Much like Parsing Goggles, Summoning Gloves come in different styles to accommodate agents’ needs. Such styles include:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>fingerless gloves</strong><br/>used primarily by Branch-focused agents, as their slim design does not impede movement</li>
                        <li><strong>surgical gloves</strong><br/>used primarily by Primary and Urgent Care agents who may need full dexterity when handling patients; comes in both reusable and disposable styles</li>
                        <li><strong>work gloves</strong><br/>used primarily by Branch Recovery Specialists, as their bulky design helps increase AV output to aid in quick cleanup</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Upon completion of training, the following agents are given a pair of Summoning Gloves:</p>
                    <ul class="two-col">
                        <li>Branch Administrator</li>
                        <li>Branch Coordinator</li>
                        <li>Branch Recovery Specialist</li>
                        <li>Target Hunter</li>
                        <li>Vice Management Specialist</li>
                        <li>Vice Management Coordinator</li>
                        <li>Floor Manager</li>
                        <li>Traffic Coordinator</li>
                        <li>Technician</li>
                        <li>Textile Engineer</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h3 id="cleansing-boots">Cleansing Boots</h3>
                    <p>Similar to Summoning Gloves, these steel-toed work boots have soles lined with AV. They are used primarily for Branch cleanup, but can also be deployed as a last-resort means of defense within the Branch Arena.</p>
                    <p>The AV-charged soles make for speedy, efficient, and sanitary Branch cleanup, neutralizing and destroying sites littered with VG. Cleansing boots are activated by tapping the steel toe against the ground three times in quick succession, and can be deactivated by doing the same. Cleansing Boots are typically replaced every two years or as the tread wears down.</p>
                    <p>Upon completion of training, the following agents are given a pair of Cleansing Boots:</p>
                    <ul class="two-col">
                        <li>Branch Administrator</li>
                        <li>Branch Coordinator</li>
                        <li>Branch Recovery Specialist</li>
                        <li>Target Hunter</li>
                        <li>Technician</li>
                        <li>Textile Engineer</li>
