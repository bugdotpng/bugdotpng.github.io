                    <h3 class="has-label" id="branch-admin">Branch Administrator <span class="label">PHS01-123</span></h3>
                    <p>Branch Administrators are highly skilled, experienced agents enlisted by <a href="#vma">Vice Management Administrators</a> to address Branches for aggressive or threatening Vices. They are specially trained to commit, but will rescind if possible and suspend only if necessary for patient or agent safety.</p>
                    <p>While Vice Management Administrators are focused on the Branch Policy and discovering patterns in Vice behavior, Branch Administrators are primarily brought in for extra firepower, often leaning on their powerful and versatile patch. These agents are quick on their feet, process information quickly, and are skilled in decision-making under pressure.</p>
                    <p>Branch Administrators must complete Rescission Training and are required to have a patch. Both native and calibrated patches are accepted, though due to the repeated use, native patches are likely to be more reliable. Branch Administrators can also be found on the Urgent Care and Public Deployment teams. There are often minute differences between the same role on different teams.</p>
                    <p>Primary Care Branch Administrators assist with <a href="../../services/primary-care/vice-management.html">Vice management</a> and <a href="../../services/primary-care/rescission.html">rescission</a> services.</p>
                    <h3 class="has-label" id="branch-coordinator">Branch Coordinator <span class="label">PHS02-123</span></h3>
                    <p>Trained to commit Branches, these agents typically accompany <a href="#vma">Vice Management Administrators</a> or <a href="#branch-admin">Branch Administrators</a> and serve as support for more complex Branches. They have less experience than Branch Administrators, but are still an invaluable addition to any team due to their breadth of knowledge and wide range of skills.</p>
                    <p>Where Branch Administrators may be more concerned with firepower, Branch Coordinators are typically more holistic in their support, focusing on unraveling the Branch Policy and looking for weak spots in a Vice’s exhibition. Vice Management Administrators often enlist the help of a Branch Coordinator to help perform Branch maintenance or provide extra support in regular commits. Some Branch Administrators prefer to have a Branch Coordinator accompany them when enlisted if tag-team tactics are a desired approach. While Branch Coordinators will never be expected to perform rescission, they may be enlisted for support during rescission by a Vice Management Administrator or Branch Administrator.</p>
                    <p>Branch Coordinators must complete Commit Training and are required to have a patch, either native or calibrated. Branch Coordinators can also be found on the Urgent Care and Public Deployment teams. There are often minute differences between the same role on different teams.</p>

In this case, Solutions Architects were removed from Public Deployment teams, with the directive to instead focus on training Target Hunters to fill this niche.</span></span></h3>
                    <p>An uncommon position not staffed at every station, these agents aid with particularly tricky or deceitful Vices, brought in for observation as a pseudo Adjunct. Their role is simply to detect patterns in attack mechanics and weak spots in a Vice's exhibition. While Solutions Architects are expected to stay up to date with the latest research findings, they tend to focus more on honing their perception and discernment skills, as well as mastering the MobiComm shorthand language.</p>
                    <p>Solutions Architects must complete Basic+ Training and are not required to have a patch due to their distance from the Branch Domain. Solutions Architects can also be found on the Urgent Care and Public Deployment teams. There are often minute differences between the same role on different teams.</p>
                    <p>Primary Care Solutions Architects often accompany <a href="#vma">Vice Management Administrators</a> and <a href="#branch-admin">Branch Administrators</a> to assist with <a href="../../services/primary-care/patch-calibration.html">patch calibration</a>, <a href="../../services/primary-care/vice-management.html">Vice management</a> and <a href="../../services/primary-care/rescission.html">rescission</a> services.</p>
                    <h3 class="has-label" id="brs">Branch Recovery Specialist <span class="label">PHS04-123</span></h3>
                    <p>An agent concerned primarily with post-Branch events, Branch Recovery Specialists clean Branch sites and inspect the patient to ensure the Branch was properly addressed. These agents approve incoming referrals from Urgent Care and typically facilitate patient discharge. Branch Recovery Specialists are called in after every Branch, regardless if it was suspended, committed, or even rescinded. These agents often need to be prepared for rogue Branches.</p>
                    <p>Branch Recovery Specialists must complete Suspension Training and are required to have a patch, either native or calibrated. Branch Recovery Specialists can also be found on the Urgent Care and Public Deployment teams. There are often minute differences between the same role on different teams.</p>
                    <p>Primary Care Branch Recovery Specialists assist with <a href="../../services/primary-care/vice-management.html">Vice management</a> and <a href="../../services/primary-care/rescission.html">rescission</a> services.</p>
                    <h3 class="has-label" id="vma">Vice Management Administrator <span class="label">PHS06-100</span></h3>
                    <p>Vice Management Administrators facilitate long-term care and devise treatment plans for patients with an active Vice. These agents guide patients through their Vice journey, whether they are looking for Vice management or are pursuing rescission, Vice Management Administrators are with them every step of the way. While expected to be experts of the research database, these agents are also expected to be experts of their respective patients’ cases.</p>
                    <p>While many Vice Management Administrators are capable of providing care alone, for more extreme cases, they typically enlist the help of other agents to form a comprehensive care team. Some of these enlisted agents include <a href="#blight-specialist">Blight Specialists</a>, <a href="#solutions-architect">Solutions Architects</a>, or <a href="#branch-admin">Branch Administrators</a>.</p>
                    <p>Vice Management Administrators must complete Rescission Training and are required to have a patch. Both native and calibrated patches are accepted, though due to the repeated use, native patches are likely to be more reliable.</p>
                    <p>While they may not facilitate treatment directly, Vice Management Administrators are involved in all forms of treatment and services offered by Primary Care. VMAs ultimately choose which services a patient is in need of, and in addition to facilitating the referral, will have a close relationship with the agent providing service so as to track the patient’s progress. VMAs perform <a href="../../services/primary-care/vice-management.html">Vice management</a> and <a href="../../services/primary-care/rescission.html">rescission</a>, and oversee <a href="../../services/primary-care/blight-management.html">blight management</a>, <a href="../../services/primary-care/av-enhancement.html">AV enhancement</a>, and <a href="../../services/primary-care/patch-calibration.html">patch calibration</a> therapies. VMAs will likely also have their patients receive <a href="../../services/primary-care/management-scans.html">management scans</a> throughout their treatment.</p>
                    <h3 class="has-label" id="vmc">Vice Management Coordinator <span class="label">PHS07-100</span></h3>
                    <p>These agents are typically assigned to a specific <a href="#vma">Vice Management Administrator</a> and act as support and backup in Branch management. Similar in function to a <a href="./urgent-care.html#traffic-coordinator">Traffic Coordinator</a> and <a href="#branch-coordinator">Branch Coordinator</a>, these agents are not as experienced as their superiors, but are invaluable assets to treatment teams by tending to administrative and record-keeping duties so as to allow their Vice Management Administrator to focus primarily on treatment.</p>
                    <p>Much like Traffic and Branch Coordinators, Vice Management Coordinators are typically more holistic in their Branch support, focusing on unraveling the Branch Policy and looking for weak spots in a Vice’s exhibition. Many Vice Management Coordinators tend to have a defensive patch to shield their Vice Management Administrator in the Branch Domain.</p>
                    <p>Vice Management Coordinators must complete Commit Training and are required to have a patch, either native or calibrated.</p>
                    <p>Like VMAs, these agents are involved with every step of a patient’s treatment plan, available for further review in <a href="../../services/primary-care/index.html">Services: Primary Care</a>. In addition to Branch support, VMCs provide invaluable support outside of the Branch Domain by performing administrative tasks that keep the VMA informed of the patient’s status. Documentation and status report, especially with trickier Vices like <a href="../../vrc/classes/delta.html">Deltas</a> and <a href="../../vrc/classes/epsilon.html">Epsilons</a>, are integral to providing accurate, holistic care.</p>
                    <h3 class="has-label" id="record-proctor">Record Proctor <span class="label">PHS08-100</span></h3>
                    <p>Record Proctors are analytical agents who determine if and how patients should be admitted for care based on the details provided by an Intake Coordinator, Floor Manager, or Branch Administrator. These agents are extremely observant and detail-oriented and typically pride themselves on extensive database understanding. </p>
                    <p>If the patient is new to the system&mdash;whether a stable referral from the Urgent Care or Public Deployment team or a self-admit from Primary Care&mdash;the Record Proctor will perform a VGDS (Vitiumglomerorum Detection Screening), propose a starting classification, and assemble a preliminary treatment plan, then pass the patient off to a <a href="#vma">Vice Management Administrator</a> to begin long-term treatment. If an existing patient is referred from Urgent Care or Public Deployment, the Record Proctor will reassess the patient’s status and record any important updates or behavioral anomalies before passing them on to their Vice Management Administrator.</p>
                    <p>These agents also perform regular <a href="../../services/primary-care/management-scans.html">management scans</a> for existing patients to track treatment progress, commit efficacy, and any core growth made between Branches. Record Proctors are data-oriented, and tend to observe patients “from a distance” by rigorously reviewing their charts to offer any treatment recommendations to the Vice Management Administrator.</p>
                    <p>Record Proctors must complete Basic Training and are not required to have a patch.</p>
                    <h3 class="has-label" id="blight-specialist">Blight Specialist <span class="label">PHS09-100</span></h3>
                    <p>Blight Specialists focus exclusively on monitoring and treating the blights of patients referred by Vice Management Administrators. Patients are typically referred to these agents when they have persistent or aggressive blights after a recently committed Branch or even after rescission.</p>
                    <p>Blight Specialists monitor changes in severity and are able to prescribe Suppressants and administer AV Shots as needed. These agents also have a unique relationship with the Observation team, where they often contribute observations, attend research seminars, and help administer research studies.</p>
                    <p>Blight Specialists must complete Suspension Training and are required to have a patch, either native or calibrated. These agents perform <a href="../../services/primary-care/blight-management.html">blight management</a> and work closely with <a href="#vma">Vice Management Administrators</a> and <a href="#record-proctor">Record Proctors</a>.</p>
                    <h3 class="has-label" id="av-specialist">AV Specialist <span class="label">PHS10-100</span></h3>
                    <p>AV Specialists are primarily concerned with a Host’s production of AV and facilitate AV enhancement therapy where patients are provided support for patch establishment and restoration, as well as general AV output. Additionally, these agents perform patch calibration, a therapy wherein a patient’s patch is “tweaked” to better suit their Vice’s exhibition. Vice Management Administrators typically refer patients to an AV Specialist if a more holistic Vice management approach is required in the event of Vices with a higher threat level.</p>
                    <p>Depending on the patients, these agents can facilitate manual AV enhancement through physical touch or by bolstering the natural production of AV through meditation or environmental changes. In certain cases, an AV specialist may also administer AV Shots to supplement AV output, though they typically prefer to remain holistic in their treatment style and will instead refer patients to a Blight Specialist.</p>
                    <p>AV Specialists must complete Suspension Training and are required to have a patch, either native or calibrated. These agents perform <a href="../../services/primary-care/av-enhancement.html">AV enhancement therapies</a> and <a href="../../services/primary-care/patch-calibration.html">patch calibration</a>, and work closely with <a href="#vma">Vice Management Administrators</a>.</p>
                    <h3 class="has-label" id="branch-proctor">Branch Proctor <span class="label">PHS11-100</span></h3>
                    <p>These agents serve the niche role of facilitating initiated Branches in the Primary Care observation chambers. Like Aggregation agents, Branch Proctors never come in direct contact with patients, though they do remotely monitor vitals and communicate with Adjuncts from the observation deck. Branch Proctors are the ones to officially instigate Branches using a remote low-level detonation device that overcharges the Vice’s network.</p>
                    <p>Unlike Solutions Architects or other pseudo Adjuncts, Branch Proctors do not directly observe Branches, and instead collect any and all communications and observations logged by Adjuncts during the Branch. After the Branch is terminated, the Branch Proctor compiles the logs and high-level Branch data to be added to the patient’s record and reviewed by Report Coordinators. Agents enlisted for backup must wait for Branch Proctor approval before using their Bypass to enter the Branch.</p>
                    <p>Branch Proctors must complete Basic Training and are not required to have a patch. Branch Proctors facilitate Branches for <a href="#vma">Vice Management Administrators</a> administering <a href="../../services/primary-care/vice-management.html">Vice management</a> and <a href="../../services/primary-care/rescission.html">rescission</a> services.</p>
                    <h3 class="has-label" id="intake-coordinator">Intake Coordinator <span class="label">PHS12-120</span></h3>
                    <p>Intake Coordinators are public relations agents and the face of Primary Care. These agents are calm and observant and provide the first wave of patient data based on their observations through their <a href="../careers/gear.html#parsing-goggles">Parsing Goggles</a> and the information collected in their initial paperwork. Intake Coordinators refer new patients to the <a href="#record-proctor">Record Proctor</a>, who ultimately determines a preliminary treatment plan.</p>
                    <p>These agents are familiar with the research database and demonstrate exemplary customer service in being able to relay the often technical jargon of Vice management to patients in an accessible and approachable way. In addition to performing preliminary screenings, Intake Coordinators also perform administrative duties, such as calling patients for appointment reminders, followups or status updates. They also administer, review, and file patient paperwork.</p>
                    <p>Intake Coordinators must complete Basic Training and are not required to have a patch. Intake Coordinators can also be found on the Urgent Care team. There are often minute differences between the same role on different teams.</p>

                        </div>
                        <p>Agents in Urgent Care provide acute care and treat at-risk patients from both Primary Care and Public Deployment, as well as public admissions. Urgent Care is trained to commit threatening Branches and refer patients back to Primary Care to resume or begin treatment.</p>

                        </div>
                        <p>Agents in Public Deployment are on-call 24/7, often patrolling high-traffic hot spots, led by their resident Target Hunter. These agents respond to public Branches or can be requested to monitor a potential threat. These agents also address post-Branch cleanup to clear the area of VG and ensure no anomalies have occurred.</p>
