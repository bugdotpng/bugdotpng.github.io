                    <h3 class="has-label" id="branch-admin">Branch Administrator <span class="label">PHS01-123</span></h3>
                    <p>Branch Administrators are highly skilled, experienced agents enlisted by Floor Managers to address Branches for aggressive or threatening Vices. They are specially trained to commit, but will rescind if possible and suspend only if necessary for patient or agent safety.</p>
                    <p>While Floor Managers are focused on the Branch Policy and discovering patterns in Vice behavior, Branch Administrators are primarily brought in for extra firepower, often leaning on their powerful and versatile patch. These agents are quick on their feet, process information quickly, and are skilled in decision-making under pressure.</p>
                    <p>Branch Administrators must complete Rescission Training and are required to have a patch. Both native and contracted patches are accepted, though due to the repeated use, native patches are likely to be more reliable. Branch Administrators can also be found on the Primary Care and Public Deployment teams. There are often minute differences between the same role on different teams.</p>
                    <h3 class="has-label" id="branch-coordinator">Branch Coordinator <span class="label">PHS02-123</span></h3>
                    <p>Trained to commit Branches, these agents typically accompany Floor Managers or Branch Administrators and serve as support for more complex Branches. They have less experience than Branch Administrators, but are still an invaluable addition to any team due to their breadth of knowledge and wide range of skills.</p>
                    <p>Where Branch Administrators may be more concerned with firepower, Branch Coordinators are typically more holistic in their support, focusing on unraveling the Branch Policy and looking for weak spots in a Vice’s exhibition. Floor Managers often enlist the help of a Branch Coordinator in the event of an occupied Branch Administrator or if minimal backup is needed. Some Branch Administrators prefer to have a Branch Coordinator accompany them when enlisted if tag-team tactics are a desired approach.</p>
                    <p>Branch Coordinators must complete Commit Training and are required to have a patch, either native or contracted. Branch Coordinators can also be found on the Primary Care and Public Deployment teams. There are often minute differences between the same role on different teams.</p>
                    <h3 class="has-label" id="solutions-architect">Solutions Architect <span class="label">PHS03-123</span></h3>
                    <p>An uncommon position not staffed at every station, these agents aid with particularly tricky or deceitful Vices, brought in for observation as a pseudo Adjunct. Their role is simply to detect patterns in attack mechanics and weak spots in a Vice's exhibition. While Solutions Architects are expected to stay up to date with the latest research findings, they tend to focus more on honing their perception and discernment skills, as well as mastering the MobiComm shorthand language.</p>
                    <p>Where Solutions Architects in Primary Care are typically only brought in for difficult cases, Solutions Architects in Urgent Care see regular action. Branches that take place in Urgent Care typically originate from an agitated Vice, and Solutions Architects can provide a much-needed plan of attack for the Floor Manager and Branch Administrator who are often more concerned with getting the situation under control.</p>
                    <p>Solutions Architects must complete Basic+ Training and are not required to have a patch due to their distance from the Branch Arena. Solutions Architects can also be found on the Primary Care and Public Deployment teams. There are often minute differences between the same role on different teams.</p>
                    <h3 class="has-label" id="brs">Branch Recovery Specialist <span class="label">PHS04-123</span></h3>
                    <p>An agent concerned primarily with post-Branch events, Branch Recovery Specialists clean Branch sites and inspect the patient to ensure the Branch was properly addressed. These agents approve the referral of patients from Urgent Care to Primary Care after determining the patient is Stable. Branch Recovery Specialists are called in after every Branch, regardless if it was suspended, committed, or even rescinded. These agents often need to be prepared for rogue Branches.</p>
                    <p>As part of the Urgent Care team, these agents can also facilitate low-level AV enhancement therapy to stabilize a patient. If a patient is displaying chronic fatigue or blights, the Branch Recovery Specialist is likely to refer the patient to Primary Care to be seen by an AV Specialist or Blight Specialist.</p>
                    <p>Branch Recovery Specialists must complete Suspension Training and are required to have a patch, either native or contracted. Branch Recovery Specialists can also be found on the Primary Care and Public Deployment teams. There are often minute differences between the same role on different teams.</p>
                    <h3 class="has-label" id="intake-coordinator">Intake Coordinator <span class="label">PHS12-120</span></h3>
                    <p>Intake Coordinators are public relations agents and the face Urgent Care. These agents are calm and observant and provide the first wave of patient data based on their observations through their Parsing Goggles and the information collected in their initial paperwork. Intake Coordinators refer new patients to the Floor Manager, who ultimately determines an acute treatment plan.</p>
                    <p>These agents are familiar with the research database and demonstrate exemplary customer service in being able to relay the often technical jargon of Vice management to patients in an accessible and approachable way. In addition to performing preliminary screenings, Intake Coordinators also perform administrative duties, such as facilitating patient paperwork and calling discharged patients status updates.</p>
                    <p>Intake Coordinators must complete Basic Training and are not required to have a patch. Intake Coordinators can also be found on the Primary Care team. There are often minute differences between the same role on different teams.</p>
                    <h3 class="has-label" id="floor-manager">Floor Manager <span class="label">PHS13-020</span></h3>
                    <p>Floor Managers oversee the Urgent Care intake bay and dictate the flow of treatment, responding to rogue Branches and even instigating Branches with the intent to commit them and provide relief. Floor Managers are information banks that are efficient, responsive and calculated. To avoid conflicting priorities, Urgent Care intake bays are typically assigned a single Floor Manager per 8-hour shift.</p>
                    <p>Floor Managers have a strong relationship with Forecast Specialists and rely on their Traffic Coordinators to help keep the intake bay moving. After a patient’s Branch has been committed or they have been stabilized, Floor Managers pass them to a Branch Recovery Specialist to verify their status before referring them to the Record Administrator in Primary Care where a long-term treatment plan is established.</p>
                    <p>Floor Managers must complete Commit Training. Both native and contracted patches are accepted, though due to the repeated use, native patches are likely to be more reliable.</p>
                    <h3 class="has-label" id="traffic-coordinator">Traffic Coordinator <span class="label">PHS14-020</span></h3>
                    <p>Traffic Coordinators are the glue that holds the Urgent Care intake bay together by performing physicals, monitoring patient statuses, and facilitating treatment assigned by the Floor Manager on staff. These agents are meticulous and detail-oriented and work alongside Floor Managers as their right-hand agents to help organize and facilitate the flow of incoming patients.</p>
                    <p>While Traffic Coordinators can work with anyone, they often prefer to work alongside a specific Floor Manager throughout their career to bolster their relationship and work more efficiently during high-stress times. Traffic Coordinators are trained to suspend in the event of a rogue Branch or absence of more qualified agents, though Floor Managers are usually not far behind to offer support.</p>
                    <p>Traffic Coordinators must complete Suspension Training and are required to have a patch, either native or contracted.</p>
