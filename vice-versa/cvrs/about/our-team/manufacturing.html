                        <p>The Manufacturing team is unique in that these agents are not confined to a specific station. These agents are mobile, typically visiting multiple different stations throughout the day to check on gear status and offer repairs or extra supplies if needed. Click on a role to learn more about their area of expertise and the training they received.</p>

                    <p>These agents are masters of their craft, knowing all the ins and outs of their assigned technology products. Each Product Engineer focuses on one of the five <a href="../careers/gear.html#tech">CVRS technology products</a>: MobiComm, DigiData, Bypass, AVCharge, and VGMeter. They perform regular bug fixes for their respective code bases or perform hardware maintenance if an agent’s product is not performing up to par.</p>
                    <p>Additionally, these agents are always researching ways to make their respective products more efficient. Product Engineers occasionally observe agents using their products, both in and outside of the Branch Domain. Based on these observations, Product Engineers will propose product enhancements to their respective <a href="#technician">Technicians</a>, who will review and implement if the ask is reasonable or made by multiple agents from different areas.</p>
                    <p>When product enhancements are introduced, these agents conduct in-person trainings at individual CVRS stations, providing guidance on how to properly use the newly-enhanced products.</p>
                    <p>Product Engineers must complete Basic+ Training and are not required to have a patch due to their distance from the Branch Domain.</p>
                    <h3 class="has-label" id="textile-engineer">Textile Engineer <span class="label">R09-003</span></h3>
                    <p>These agents are masters of their craft, knowing all the ins and outs of their assigned gear. Each Textile Engineer focuses on one of the three <a href="../careers/gear.html#gear">CVRS uniform articles</a>: Parsing Goggles, Summoning Gloves, and Cleansing Boots. They perform article mending and can even help replenish AV for Summoning Gloves and Cleansing Boots after heavy use.</p>

                    <p>Technicians are highly-skilled manufacturers, split into two sub-teams: Product Technicians and Textile Technicians. Product Technicians create the products maintained by the <a href="#product-engineer">Product Engineers</a>: MobiComm, DigiData, Bypass, AVCharge, and VGMeter. Textile Technicians create the gear maintained by the <a href="#textile-engineer">Textile Engineers</a>: Parsing Goggles, Summoning Gloves, and Cleansing Boots.</p>
                    <p>These agents review the observations and feedback from Textile and Product Engineers and only comply with enhancement asks if they are relevant across multiple stations. In the instance of isolated issues, Technicians will work with the local <a href="./aggregation.html#forecast-specialist">Forecast Specialists</a> and <a href="./aggregation.html#report-coordinator">Report Coordinators</a> to better understand the Vice trends causing these unique needs. A small team of Technicians may be deployed to the local CVRS station to observe Branches and tweak their products accordingly.</p>
                    <p>Technicians must complete Basic+ Training and are not required to have a patch. Technician is a unique class of agents that contains tiers based on experience level and modifiers based on focus, outlined below:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>[Product/Textile] Technician I (0-2 years experience)</li>
                        <li>[Product/Textile] Technician II (2-4 years experience)</li>
                        <li>[Product/Textile] Technician III (5-7 years experience)</li>
                        <li>[Product/Textile] Technician IV (7-9 years experience)</li>
                        <li>Lead [Product/Textile] Technician (10 years experience)</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Lead Product and Textile Technicians are responsible for convening with the Primary Care, Urgent Care, and Public Deployment teams to gather data and feedback, as well as facilitate on-site product maintenance, if needed. Lead Technicians may enlist the help of other Technicians of various levels to help perform on-site maintenance.</p>
