                    <h3 class="has-label" id="research-proctor">Research Proctor <span class="label">R04-020</span></h3>
                    <p>These agents are tasked with organizing and facilitating research case studies and assigning the available research analysts appropriately. These agents do not interact directly with patients, though they are expected to complete Basic+ training so as to fully understand the duties of their analysts and instruct them accordingly.</p>
                    <p>Research Proctors often work closely with <a href="./aggregation.html#lsa">Lead Station Aggregators</a> to request funding and prioritize research initiatives. Research Proctors also work alongside <a href="./primary-care.html#branch-proctor">Branch Proctors</a>, typically observing Branches from the observation deck. These agents are highly organized and skilled at multitasking, often needing to facilitate multiple projects at once. They are analytical and confident in their discernment, as well as adept communicators.</p>
                    <p>Branch Proctors must complete Basic+ Training and are not required to have a patch.</p>
                    <h3 class="has-label" id="vice-analyst">Vice Analyst <span class="label">R05-020</span></h3>
                    <p>Vice Analysts are interested in the biological details of Vices, from advent to rescission or dispersion. These agents focus on big-picture data and are brought in to observe Branches as a pseudo Adjunct, typically accompanying patients through their Vice journey from start to finish. Common research areas include the circumstances of advent, life cycles, and reproductive habits, as well as biological differences between classifications.</p>
                    <p>Upon onboarding, Vice Analysts are typically assigned to a single Primary Care or Urgent Care team. As they become more familiar with their craft, they often swap teams to compare their findings between environments, researching the differences in Branch properties and Vice behavior between the calmer, more predictable nature of Primary Care Branches versus the often volatile Branches of Urgent Care. Vice Analysts in Primary Care typically accompany <a href="./primary-care.html#vma">Vice Management Administrators</a>, while those in Urgent Care partner with <a href="./urgent-care.html#floor-manager">Floor Managers</a>.</p>
                    <p>Vice Analysts must complete Basic+ Training and are not required to have a patch due to their distance from the Branch Domain. </p>
                    <h3 class="has-label" id="branch-analyst">Branch Analyst <span class="label">R06-020</span></h3>
                    <p>Branch Analysts focus predominantly on the science and physics of Branches, what causes them, and how Vices are able to execute them. Because of these research areas, they commonly accompany <a href="./urgent-care.html#floor-manager">Floor Managers</a> in Urgent Care and are pseudo Adjuncts for Branches initiated in the Primary Care Observation Chambers. These agents also partner with <a href="#behavioral-analyst">Behavioral Analysts</a> to identify trends in the events both leading up to and after Branches, as well as with Branch Recovery Specialists from each team to document Vice behavior after Branches have been addressed.</p>
                    <p>In addition to studying suspensions, commits, and rescissions, Branch Analysts use this knowledge to discover and test alternative ways to fight back against Vices. Whether that’s devising plans of attack for local trends or discovering new ways to wield patches, Branch Analysts can be trusted to always keep our approaches and treatment plans fresh.</p>
                    <p>Branch Analysts must complete Basic+ Training and are not required to have a patch due to their distance from the Branch Domain.</p>
                    <h3 class="has-label" id="behavioral-analyst">Behavioral Analyst <span class="label">R07-020</span></h3>
                    <p>Behavioral Analysts study the ethology behind rogue Branches and the circumstances that drive Vices to initiate impulsive or out-of-character Branches. These agents are interested in finding and documenting anomalies specifically in expected Vice behaviors and have made strong contributions to the Vice classification database. Most new classes and subclasses are proposed by these agents.</p>
                    <p>While Behavioral Analysts can and do observe Primary Care cases, they have the most success with finding anomalies in Urgent Care cases, and often accompany <a href="./urgent-care.html#branch-admin">Branch Administrators</a> during <a href="../../services/urgent-care/branch-remediation.html">Branch remediation</a>. These agents also have a good working relationship with <a href="./public-deployment.html#target-hunter">Target Hunters</a> and <a href="./aggregation.html#forecast-specialist">Forecast Specialists</a>, where they discuss anomalies and observations in local patterns.</p>
                    <p>Behavioral Analysts must complete Basic+ Training and are not required to have a patch due to their distance from the Branch Domain. </p>
                    <h3 class="has-label" id="exposure-analyst">Exposure Analyst <span class="label">R11-020</span></h3>
                    <p>These niche agents study the long-term physiological effects of repeated Branch exposure on the human body. Additionally, Exposure Analysts monitor vitals during active Branches and perform regular physicals for both patients and agents alike. While they do study patients, their focus is typically on agents and the effects of long-term Branch exposure.</p>
                    <p>This is a relatively new field of study, and the findings have been inconclusive thus far. Exposure Analysts observe anyone who has experienced Branches, but are most interested in Urgent Care agents, due to their repeated exposure to Branches in quick succession. <a href="./urgent-care.html#branch-admin">Branch Administrators</a>, <a href="./urgent-care.html#branch-coordinator">Branch Coordinators</a>, <a href="./urgent-care.html#floor-manager">Floor Managers</a>, and <a href="./primary-care.html#vma">Vice Management Administrators</a> are common research subjects due to their high volume of Branch activity.</p>
