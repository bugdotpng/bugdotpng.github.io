                        <p>Agents in Public Deployment are on-call 24/7, often patrolling high-traffic hot spots, led by their resident Target Hunter. These agents respond to public Branches or can be requested to monitor a potential threat. These agents also address post-Branch cleanup to clear the area of VG and ensure no anomalies have occurred.</p>

                    <p>Branch Administrators are highly skilled, experienced agents directed by <a href="#target-hunter">Target Hunters</a> to address public or rogue Branches. They are specially trained to commit, but will rescind if possible and suspend only if necessary for patient, agent, or public safety.</p>
                    <p>Due to the volatile and unpredictable nature of public Branches, Branch Administrators are brought in to almost every Branch, if available, for increased efficiency and extra firepower, often leaning on their powerful and versatile patch. These agents are quick on their feet, process information quickly, and are skilled in decision-making under pressure.</p>
                    <p>Branch Administrators must complete Rescission Training and are required to have a patch. Both native and calibrated patches are accepted, though due to the repeated use, native patches are likely to be more reliable. Branch Administrators can also be found on the Primary Care and Urgent Care teams. There are often minute differences between the same role on different teams.</p>
                    <p>Public Deployment Branch Administrators assist with <a href="../../services/public-deployment/rumen-disposal.html">rumen disposal</a> and address any Branches found by Target Hunters during <a href="../../services/public-deployment/event-patrol.html">event patrol</a>. They may also facilitate <a href="../../services/public-deployment/site-cleanup.html">Branch site cleanup</a> alongside a <a href="#brs">Branch Recovery Specialist</a>.</p>
                    <h3 class="has-label" id="branch-coordinator">Branch Coordinator <span class="label">PHS02-123</span></h3>
                    <p>Trained to commit Branches, these agents typically accompany <a href="#branch-admin">Branch Administrators</a> or <a href="#target-hunter">Target Hunters</a>. They have less experience than Branch Administrators, but are still an invaluable addition to any team due to their breadth of knowledge and wide range of skills.</p>
                    <p>Where Branch Administrators may be more concerned with firepower, Branch Coordinators are typically more holistic in their support, focusing on unraveling the Branch Policy and looking for weak spots in a Vice’s exhibition. Target Hunters often enlist the help of a Branch Coordinator in the event of an occupied Branch Administrator or if minimal backup is needed. Some Branch Administrators prefer to have a Branch Coordinator accompany them when enlisted if tag-team tactics are a desired approach.</p>
                    <p>Branch Coordinators must complete Commit Training and are required to have a patch, either native or calibrated. Branch Coordinators can also be found on the Primary Care and Urgent Care teams. There are often minute differences between the same role on different teams.</p>
                    <p>Public Deployment Branch Coordinators can help address any Branches found by Target Hunters during <a href="../../services/public-deployment/event-patrol.html">event patrol</a>. They may also facilitate <a href="../../services/public-deployment/site-cleanup.html">Branch site cleanup</a> alongside a <a href="#brs">Branch Recovery Specialist</a>.</p>
                    <h3 class="has-label" id="brs">Branch Recovery Specialist <span class="label">PHS04-123</span></h3>
                    <p>An agent concerned primarily with post-Branch events, Branch Recovery Specialists clean Branch sites and inspect the patient to ensure the Branch was properly addressed. These agents approve the referral of patients after determining they are stable; a patient whose Branch was committed is referred to Primary Care, while a patient with a suspended Branch is referred to Urgent Care for Branch remediation. Branch Recovery Specialists are called in after every Branch, regardless if it was suspended, committed, or even rescinded. In the event of an occupied Target Hunter, Branch Recovery Specialists are also able to handle public relations.</p>
                    <p>Branch Recovery Specialists must complete Suspension Training and are required to have a patch, either native or calibrated. Branch Recovery Specialists can also be found on the Primary Care and Public Deployment teams. There are often minute differences between the same role on different teams.</p>
                    <p>While Public Deployment Branch Recovery Specialists perform post-Branch assessments and refer patients to either Primary Care or Urgent Care, depending on how their Branch was addressed, their main focus is facilitating and leading <a href="../../services/public-deployment/site-cleanup.html">Branch site cleanup</a> services.</p>
                    <h3 class="has-label" id="target-hunter">Target Hunter <span class="label">PHS05-003</h3>
                    <p>Target Hunters are integral to the success of Public Deployment teams, so much so that a Public Deployment team cannot exist without one. These agents patrol high-traffic areas or hot spots in search of rogue or unaddressed Branches, guided by personal observations or those submitted by a Forecast Specialist. Target Hunters are highly intuitive and extremely observant and are often able to recognize Branches in staging or production by body language alone. They are specially trained for efficient suspension if alone, but if accompanied by a Branch Administrator, can aid in committing the Branch.</p>
                    <p>Target Hunters are the face of Public Deployment, and often handle public relations and give reports to law enforcement and media. These agents also record data and help clean up Branch sites. Target Hunters can also be contracted to observe high-traffic public events and act as a first responder to address any rogue Branches, typically with the help of a Branch Administrator and Branch Coordinator.</p>
                    <p>Target Hunters must complete Commit Training and are required to have a patch, either native or calibrated.</p>
                    <p>In addition to event patrol, Target Hunters also assist in <a href="../../services/public-deployment/site-cleanup.html">Branch site cleanup</a> and facilitate the <a href="../../services/public-deployment/rumen-disposal.html">disposal of reported rumen</a> alongside <a href="#branch-admin">Branch Administrators</a>.</p>
