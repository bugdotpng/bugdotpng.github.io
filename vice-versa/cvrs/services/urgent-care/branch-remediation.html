                    <p>If a patient’s Branch was recently suspended, either personally, or by CVRS staff, they can be admitted for Branch Remediation, which entails the instigation of a subsequent Branch that the Urgent Care team then commits. Suspensions drastically increase the risk of rogue Branches, especially in the days following suspension. Branch Remediation is a preventative procedure, rather than a reactive one, and the initiation of a rogue Branch is not required in order for a Branch to be remediated. After admission, Branch Remediation will be performed as quickly as the schedule allows so as to not expose the patient to any unnecessary risk.</p>

                            <h3>Assessment</h3>
                        </div>
                        <p>After admission, the Floor Manager will meet with the patient to review the basics, such as recent Vice behavior, its classification, and notable characteristics of the Vice’s Branch Policy, if known. Patients who do not know the classification of their Vice will be treated with the same attention as if their Vice had a high threat level.</p>
                        <p>After the Floor Manager reviews the information, they will gather the necessary team members to perform the Branch Remediation. This team will look different between classifications and recent Branch activity. The Floor Manager will then inform the patient of the process, and with their consent, will begin the remediation process.</p>

                            <h3>Branch Instigation</h3>
                        </div>
                        <p>All members of the Branch Remediation team will place their hand on the patient, most commonly on the shoulder, back, or upper arm. Using a <a href="../../about/careers/gear.html#bypass">Bypass</a>, a Branch Administrator will instigate a Branch, and upon moving into staging, the Branch will queue the agents in contact with the patient.</p>
                        <p>Instigated Branches typically have shorter staging times and can result in mild electrostatic shock. Most Floor Managers enlist extra agents, if available, to combat the potentially aggressive behavior that Branch instigation can trigger. Learn more about this process and the risks associated with it in <a href="../../vrc/branches/fringe.html#instigation">Branch Instigation</a>.</p>

                            <h3>Commit Facilitation</h3>
                        </div>
                        <p>Once admitted to the Branch Domain, the team will work to commit the Branch, using their broad array of skills, attack strategies, and patches to address the Branch in a timely manner. Committing a Branch will negate any recent augmentation or germination progress made by the Vice and give the patient a longer break until the next Branch compared to leaving it suspended.</p>
                        <p>During this Branch, agents may facilitate rescission if the Branch Administrator sees a clear line to do so, but this is not common. Most teams are focused on committing the Branch, then referring the patient to a Vice Management Administrator in Primary Care to facilitate rescission in a more controlled environment. The Floor Manager will monitor the Branch from the corporeal realm and send in reinforcements if needed.</p>

                                <p>While not mandatory, we highly recommend pursuing Branch Remediation after any suspension.
