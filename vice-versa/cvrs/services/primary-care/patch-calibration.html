                    <p><a href="../../about/our-team/primary-care.html#av-specialist">AV Specialists</a> are unique agents who are able to influence a Host’s patch design with repeated hand-to-summoning-site sessions, similar to AV enhancement therapies. Patches that have received calibration still belong to the Host, but are simply taking a temporary form influenced by an AV Specialist. Regular maintenance is required to keep the calibrated patch in its current form, as prolonged periods without these sessions can cause the patch to revert to its original form.</p>
                    <h2>The Patch Calibration Process</h2>
                    <p>A patch’s form can be influenced by external AV sources. The patch support subset of traditional AV enhancement therapies focuses on elevating the patient’s AV levels at an even rate, resulting in a solidified patch. While patch calibration can seem similar on the surface, this process entails manipulating AV levels in different directions to affect the final AV output and influence the design of the patch.</p>
                    <p>Dense pockets of AV lie directly under the skin of the summoning site. When a patient summons their patch, these pockets release the AV in a pre-determined pattern that exits through the skin and materializes into the patch. By targeting these pockets and manipulating their AV output, AV Specialists can “influence” the final design of the patch.</p>
                    <p>Patch calibration entails multiple consecutive visits, as the AV Specialist will need to study the patient’s AV patterns through repeated intentional patch summoning sessions. Once the agent is familiar with their patterns, they will begin trial-and-error sessions where they influence AV levels in different directions to see which pockets control what properties. Once the patterns are understood, regular sessions will be needed to maintain the AV distribution, as it is likely to return to normal over a period of time.</p>
                    <p>The final patch design will still resemble its original makeup, but will now contain features to better combat their Vice’s exhibition. For example, if a patient has a bludgeoning patch, such as a hammer, but their Vice’s exhibition has a thick outer skin, the patch may be influenced into having piercing or slashing capabilities, such as a honed edge where the hammer head used to be. This process can also be used to bolster patch capabilities further than standard patch support therapies. For example, if a bludgeoning patch is a good fit, but not inflicting enough damage, it can be fortified to enhance its characteristics, such as increasing the weight or surface area of its bludgeoning apparatus.</p>
                    <p>This is a time-intensive process that requires patience and fortitude. AV Specialists are dedicated to finding the right formula for their patients, meaning this service can take multiple months to be successful.</p>
                    <h3>Experimental Procedures</h3>
                    <p>As our understanding of Vices evolves, Branch Analysts in our Research sector are always looking for new ways to combat Vices, especially in the Branch Domain. Alternative methods for wielding patches have begun gaining traction among civilians, particularly merging and enhancing patches. Because these methodologies do not produce reliable results, agents are hesitant to adopt them into their treatment practices; however, these methodologies do show promise.</p>
                    <p><a href="../../vrc/bodies/av-patches.html#enhancing-patches">Patch enhancement</a> is considered a subset of patch calibration, where the patch’s design can be combined with an object in the Branch Domain to produce a novel patch for the duration of the Branch. This methodology proves difficult to coach, and even if an AV Specialist has a fair idea of which objects will result in the best end product, success is never guaranteed. Insufficient patches drive patients to manually enhance their patches. We recommend pursuing patch calibration if a patient’s patch is not meeting their expectations.</p>
                    <p>Additionally, <a href="../../vrc/bodies/av-patches.html#merging-patches">merging patches</a> is an experimental methodology often performed between a Host and their primary Adjunct. Some AV Specialists have begun to run trials, facilitating the patch merging between the patient and other agents. This is also typically only pursued as a last resort, when the current array of available patches are not well-suited to a patient’s exhibition, and traditional patch calibration will take too long. AV Specialists may send a patient back to their Vice Management Administrator with patch recommendations and a directive to pursue a new treatment team.</p>

                        <h2>Learn More about AV Specialists</h2>
                        <p>AV Specialists are primarily concerned with a Host’s production of AV and facilitate AV enhancement therapy where patients are provided support for patch establishment, contracting and restoration, as well as general AV output. Vice Management Administrators typically refer patients to an AV Specialist if a more holistic Vice management approach is required in the event of Vices with a higher threat level.</p>
