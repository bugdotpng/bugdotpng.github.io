                        <p>Immediately upon entry, patients will be greeted by an Intake Coordinator, who will provide a brief questionnaire to determine the next course of action. Scheduled appointments for established patients are automatically approved. Walk-ins, however, will be assessed by an Intake Coordinator, and the case will be approved, referred, or denied based on the information provided.</p>
                        <p>Approved cases are cleared to move to the next step, which differs between new and established patients, both outlined below. Referred cases are approved, but need to be addressed at a different location. These cases have either been referred to a different station’s Primary Care or to the station’s Urgent Care in the event of an emergency. Denied cases are relatively rare and advise the patient to instead consult a medical professional. Patients will only be eligible for reassessment if a referral from a medical professional is obtained or new symptoms manifest.</p>

                            <p>After a patient’s case is approved, a Record Administrator will perform a preliminary screening, known as a VGDS, to detect an active Vice. This rudimentary scan is performed by a VG Meter that detects dense concentrations of vitiumglomerorum (VG) in a patient’s body. A localized reading of 4.0 or higher indicates the presence of a Vice core.</p>
                            <p>Patients who receive a positive VGDS will be given a tentative, preliminary classification based on the information provided, which is subject to change. They will then be scheduled to meet with a Vice Management Specialist and establish treatment goals. Learn about these goals and other processes in <a href="./vice-management.html">Vice Management</a>.</p>
                            <p>If a patient receives a negative VGDS, their case will be denied. Patients will only be eligible for reassessment if a referral from a medical professional is obtained or new symptoms manifest.</p>

                            <p>Patients attending a schedule appointment have the opportunity to discuss any anomalies with the Record Administrator before meeting with their Vice Management Specialist. This provides the Record Administrator with the opportunity to suggest a new classification or even subclasses, if appropriate.</p>
                            <p>Walk-ins from established patients are automatically routed to a Record Administrator. A patient may request an appointment outside of their established schedule to discuss changes in Vice behavior or blights, which often requires the detail-oriented eye of a Record Administrator, who may suggest a new classification or subclass.</p>
                            <p>A patient may also request an appointment to discuss changes in their goals or report rogue Branches. Patients can also request AV Enhancement Therapy or Patch Coaching.</p>

                <p>Agents in Public Deployment are on-call 24/7, often patrolling high-traffic hot spots, led by their resident Target Hunter. These  agents respond to public Branches or can be requested to monitor a potential threat. These agents also address post-Branch cleanup to ensure no anomalies have occurred.</p>
