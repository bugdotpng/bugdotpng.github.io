                        <p>Immediately upon entry, patients will be greeted by an Intake Coordinator, who will provide a brief questionnaire to determine the next course of action. Scheduled appointments for established patients are automatically approved. Walk-ins, however, will be assessed by an Intake Coordinator, and the case will be approved, referred, or denied based on the information provided.</p>
                        <p>Approved cases are cleared to move to the next step, which differs between new and established patients, both outlined below. Referred cases are approved, but need to be addressed at a different location. These cases have either been referred to a different station’s Primary Care or to the station’s Urgent Care in the event of an emergency. Denied cases are relatively rare and advise the patient to instead consult a medical professional. Patients will only be eligible for reassessment if a referral from a medical professional is obtained or new symptoms manifest.</p>

                            <p>After a patient’s case is approved, a Record Proctor will perform a preliminary screening, known as a VGDS, to detect an active Vice. This rudimentary scan is performed by a VG Meter that detects dense concentrations of vitiumglomerorum (VG) in a patient’s body. A localized reading of 4.0 or higher indicates the presence of a Vice core.</p>
                            <p>Patients who receive a positive VGDS will be given a tentative, preliminary classification based on the information provided, which is subject to change. They will then be scheduled to meet with a <a href="../../about/our-team/primary-care#vma.html">Vice Management Administrator</a> and establish treatment goals. Learn about these goals and other processes in Vice Management.</p>
                            <p>If a patient receives a negative VGDS, their case will be denied. Patients will only be eligible for reassessment if a referral from a medical professional is obtained or new symptoms manifest.</p>

                            <p>Patients attending a scheduled appointment have the opportunity to discuss any anomalies with the Record Proctor before meeting with their Vice Management Administrator. This provides the Record Proctor with the opportunity to suggest a new classification or even subclasses, if appropriate.</p>
                            <p>Walk-ins from established patients are automatically routed to a Record Proctor. A patient may request an appointment outside of their established schedule to discuss changes in Vice behavior or blights, which often requires the detail-oriented eye of a Record Proctor, who may suggest a new classification or subclass.</p>
                            <p>A patient may also request an appointment to discuss changes in their goals or report rogue Branches. Patients can also request AV enhancement therapy or patch calibration.</p>

                <p>Agents in Public Deployment are on-call 24/7, patrolling high-traffic areas in the community, such as streets, shopping hubs, and public events. These agents respond to public and rogue Branches or can be requested to address a potential threat by calling (214) 877-8423. This team also serves as a clean-up crew after Branches have been addressed. Most CVRS stations have multiple Public Deployment teams in rotation to ensure around-the-clock care.</p>
