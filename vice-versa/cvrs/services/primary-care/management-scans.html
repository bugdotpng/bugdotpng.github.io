                    <p>This service is often performed in conjunction with other treatments, led by a <a href="../../about/our-team/primary-care.html#record-admin">Record Proctor</a>. Regular management scans help inform agents about the efficacy of treatment, as well as any potential augmentation or germination progress between Branches. Blight Specialists, AV Specialists, and even Branch Recovery Specialists may request management scans before and after treatment sessions.</p>
                    <p>These scans are called a VGMS (Vitiumglomerorum Management Scan) and produce a low-resolution black and white image of the Vice core, similar to an ultrasound. Cores typically appear as a semi-solid white mass, with denser cores appearing more opaque. Below is the VGMS output of an unclassified larval Vice.</p>
                    <figure class="captioned-media">
                        <img src="../../images/core-vgms.jpg" alt="a low-resolution black-and-white image displaying a Vice core. It resembles an ultrasound, and the Vice core is a semi-opaque oval. Small text to the side displays data, but is difficult to read."/>
                    </figure>
                    <p>As the Vice matures, it begins creating its network, typically in early adolescence. A Vice network can also be seen on a VGMS, which can be used to track germination progress. As seen below, the network appears as a mycelial-like web of tracks, which are typically fainter than the core they extend from. Young tracks may not even appear at all.</p>
                    <figure class="captioned-media">
                        <img src="../../images/core-vgms.jpg" alt="the same image as before, but the oval is more opqaue and faint white tunnels extend from the core."/>
                    </figure>
                    <p>Note the increased opacity of the above core. As a Vice matures, their core becomes more dense from an increase in stored resources and energy. Similarly, older cores tend to sport a thick, outer epithelium that shields them from attacks. This increased density and thickened epithelium can result in cores that appear almost solid white on a VGMS.</p>
                    <p>Many VGMS will also show a dense shadow around the core and junctions in the network. This is typically due to the large concentration of VG coursing through the area.</p>
                    <h2>VGMS Process</h2>
                    <p>A VGMS is administered by gliding a transducer&mdash;similar to those used in ultrasounds&mdash;across the patient’s skin, often over a thin layer of gel that helps provide a clearer image. The transducer will produce a low-resolution black and white image of the Vice core for the Record Proctor to examine. A VGMeter may also be used to aid in the assessment.</p>
                    <p>In total, a VGMS typically lasts no longer than 10 minutes, averaging around roughly 3 minutes. The Record Proctor will log their observations, inform the patient of the core’s status, then send them back to their Vice Management Administrator to discuss treatment changes. If applicable, a Record Proctor may also include treatment suggestions based on the imaging to be reviewed by the Vice Management Administrator. Alternative classification suggestions may also be provided in the Vice’s early stages.</p>
                    <h3>--omicron Vices</h3>
                    <p>In the event of an --omicron Vice, a VGMS may have difficulty providing a comprehensive view of the core’s status, as these Vices are able to camouflage both their network and their core. En lieu of a VGMS, a Record Proctor can use a VGMeter to roughly triangulate the core’s location by monitoring the VG levels. Patients with an --omicron Vice may need to have regular visits with a Record Proctor to closely monitor the Vice’s activity.</p>

                        <p>Record Proctors are analytical agents who perform regular management scans for existing patients to track treatment progress, commit efficacy, and any core growth made between Branches. Record Proctors are data-oriented, and tend to observe patients “from a distance” by rigorously reviewing their charts to offer any treatment recommendations to the Vice Management Administrator.</p>
