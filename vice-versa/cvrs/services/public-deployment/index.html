                        <p>Agents in Public Deployment are on-call 24/7, patrolling high-traffic areas in the community, such as streets, shopping hubs, and public events. These agents respond to public and rogue Branches or can be requested to address a potential threat by calling (214) 877-8423. This team also serves as a clean-up crew after Branches have been addressed. Most CVRS stations have multiple Public Deployment teams in rotation to ensure around-the-clock care.</p>

                        <h2 id="mission">Our Mission</h2>
                        <p>Public Deployment is a relatively new facet of CVRS, established in 2004. As Vices continue to evolve, the way in which they interact with us as a body of Hosts continues to evolve as well. Branches and their impact began as acute, localized instances, but have evolved in both execution and scale, often taking patients by surprise or growing to encompass large swaths of people. Public Deployment agents across the nation are dedicated to detecting and addressing Branches that threaten public safety.</p>
                        <p>As the threat levels of Vices continue to skew higher and the overall intelligence increases, Public Deployment teams are needed now more than ever to address rogue Branches at risk of affecting large groups of people. Vices, regardless of classification, have begun intentionally initiating Branches in crowded areas, a behavior previously observed exclusively in Theta Vices. This and other new behaviors can be further explored in <a href="../../vrc/biology/anomalies.html">Vice Biology: Anomalies</a>.</p>
                        <p>Public Deployment works closely with our Research team to stay on the cutting edge of discoveries. Many observations gathered in the field power discoveries and new understanding as Vices continue to evolve. But Public Deployment agents need their communities’ help in containing these events. Those who manage large-scale events or provide public services should learn about the services we offer below and reach out to the local Public Deployment team to help monitor crowds and keep our community safe.</p>

                            <h3>How to Help</h3>
                            <p>While our agents are working around the clock to maintain public safety, we can’t be everywhere at once or attend all public gatherings. We need the community’s help in prioritizing and being aware of events in advance.</p>
                            <p>While it is not required, before hosting a large-scale public event (with more than 50 expected attendees), we recommend contacting the local Public Deployment for <a href="./event-patrol.html">Event Patrol</a> services in advance.</p>
                            <p>With Branches, time is of the essence. While our agents do their best to address Branches in a timely manner, already being on the scene can save hours of in-Branch time, especially if the Branch is caught before production. In many cases, being on the scene has been the difference between life and death. Contact the local Public Deployment team today to request our Event Patrol services. It is always better to be safe than sorry.</p>

                            <h3>Beware of Scams</h3>
                            <p>Due to the national Public Deployment agent shortage, grassroots vigilante efforts have begun popping up around the country. While some of these efforts may have good intentions, they are ultimately not affiliated with CVRS and cannot guarantee the precision, technique and care provided by our agents.</p>
                            <p>Do not accept help from or contract people not affiliated with CVRS. Even former agents should not be contracted, as they are likely to not be up to date on the latest research findings and recommendations.</p>
                            <p>Always field any requests through our main hotline at (214) 877-8423 or email us at <a href="mailto:bugdotinfo@gmail.com">info@cvrs.com</a>. Due to increased traffic, wait times can be longer, so we recommend preparing accordingly and reaching out as far in advance as possible. Additionally, the Intake Coordinator at a local Urgent Care can field any requests in person.</p>
