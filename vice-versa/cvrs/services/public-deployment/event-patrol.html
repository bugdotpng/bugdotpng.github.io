                        <p>Large-scale public events are common Branch initiation spots due to the unpredictable and often overstimulating nature of crowds. Businesses can contract a team of Target Hunters in advance to keep watch and address any potential threats as they arise.</p>

                    <p>While Target Hunters are always patrolling public areas, they can also be contracted to patrol a specific area, business, or venue, especially during large-scale events. Events with less than 25 people will not be accepted. The number of Target Hunters will scale with the size of the event, with one Target Hunter to every 100 people, roughly. Target Hunters typically also enlist the help of a Branch Administrator and Branch Coordinator, who are on standby and ready to address any Branches that move into production. These agents will scale with event size as well, with each Target Hunter having one Branch Administrator.</p>
                    <p>Prior to the event, the Target Hunter may request a walkthrough to familiarize themself with the venue. During the event, they are likely to roam, but will stick to the perimeter and do not tend to interact with guests, unless necessary.</p>
                    <p>Target Hunters are extremely perceptive, observant agents with exemplary insight into behavioral sciences and body language. Aided by their Parsing Goggles, which are typically standard eyeglasses or sunglasses, they are looking for the signs of a Branch in staging or production, as well as textbook <a href="../../vrc/classes/lambda.html">Lambda advent</a> behaviors.</p>
                    <h2>Objective</h2>
                    <p>Target Hunters patrol these events to respond to initiated Branches. While preventing Branches is near-impossible, these agents are able to quickly recognize a Branch in staging and are able to suspend before too many guests are brought into the Branch as secondary or tertiary Adjuncts. AV Shots are often used as a low-key means of suspending the Branch, so as to not cause too much commotion.</p>
                    <p>If the Target Hunter is unable to reach a Branch in time and it moves into production, they will alert their Branch Administrator, then enter the Branch to stall. Depending on the severity of the Branch and the supposed threat level of the Vice, a Branch Administrator may enlist the additional help of their Branch Coordinator. Upon admission of the Branch Administrator, they will work to commit the Branch in an efficient and timely manner.</p>
                    <h2>Legal</h2>
                    <p>Prior to the event, the Target Hunter will provide the contractor with legal documents that protect the agent and CVRS from being sued for failure to perform. Branches are incredibly complex and unpredictable, and while we train our agents well, some Branches are simply unable to be addressed. Additionally, at the venue, a visible sign must be placed near the entrance that informs guests they are consenting to having any potential Branches addressed. The Target Hunter will provide the necessary verbiage in the initial meetup.</p>

                        <h2>Learn More about Target Hunters</h2>
                        <p>These agents patrol high-traffic areas or hot spots in search of rogue or unaddressed Branches. Target Hunters are highly intuitive and extremely observant and are often able to recognize Branches in staging or production by body language alone. They are specially trained for efficient suspension if alone, but if accompanied by a Branch Administrator, can aid in committing the Branch.</p>
