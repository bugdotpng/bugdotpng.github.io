                        <p>Branches, especially suspended Branches, tend to leave behind large quantities of VG after they are addressed, which can lead to increased Branch activity.

                    <p>Post-Branch VG, in large amounts, can cause similar conditions to rumina, resulting in a general feeling of unease in the area. Particularly concentrated amounts can even short out electric equipment. After a self-addressed Branch, it is best practice to call a Branch Recovery Specialist to clear the area. They are available to address both public and private Branch sites that have been recently addressed. In addition to clearing the area of VG, they can also facilitate a quick walkthrough to document general VG levels and look for any anomalies.</p>

                            <h3>Cleanup</h3>
                        </div>
                        <p>Branch Recovery Specialists (BRS) have access to proprietary CVRS technology to aid in site cleanup. Upon arrival, the BRS will be wearing a large, full-body suit not unlike a hazmat suit, but there is no need to be alarmed. Occasional exposure to moderate VG levels is generally not considered to be a risk, but regular exposure can begin to affect one’s body or lead to uncharacteristic Vice behavior. Much in the same way a radiologist steps out of the room when performing an x-ray, the trademark BRS suits are to prevent repeated exposure.</p>
                        <p>A BRS is equipped with Parsing Goggles and a VG Meter, which they use to locate and monitor VG concentrations, respectively. They will also be wearing Cleansing Boots and Summoning Gloves, two AV-charged accessories that neutralize VG concentrations.</p>
                        <p>The agent will use their various equipment to perform a thorough cleanup of the area. After the area has been cleared, they will initiate a walkthrough to both double-check the area and check for any anomalies.</p>

                            <h3>Walkthrough</h3>
                        </div>
                        <p>Using their Parsing Goggles and VG Meter, the Branch Recovery Specialist will perform a “sweep” of the area. This generally entails dragging the VG Meter along baseboards, wall junctions, or any particularly high-traffic areas to monitor VG levels. The standard reading for indoors is roughly 3.5, while outside tends to hover around 1.3. The area may be slightly higher or lower than these numbers, depending on the average reading for the area. Concern is not warranted until roughly 6 or 7 is reached.</p>

                        </div>
                        <p>Parsing Goggles are used to “double-check” their work to ensure no spots were missed, both in cleanup and during the walkthrough. At the end of their walkthrough, the agent will provide a general overview of the levels, including the highest and lowest levels documented, as well as a brief outline of the services provided.</p>

                        <p>An agent concerned primarily with post-Branch events, Branch Recovery Specialists clean Branch sites and inspect the patient to ensure the Branch was properly addressed. Branch Recovery Specialists are called in after every Branch, regardless if it was suspended, committed, or even rescinded.</p>
