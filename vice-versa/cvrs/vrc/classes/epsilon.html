                        <p>Epsilon Vices are extremely difficult to treat due to their deceptive nature. While Delta Vices shed, Epsilon Vices instead opt to keep parts of their Branch Policy hidden. Information can be gathered for all properties, but it may be incomplete. Epsilon Vices will use this gap in knowledge to their advantage to surprise Hosts and Adjuncts in the Branch Domain by expanding hidden areas of the domain or even revealing previously shrouded exhibition characteristics.</p>

                    <p>Epsilon Vices are incredibly deceptive, intentionally withholding key properties of their Branch Policy to surprise Hosts in the Branch Domain. These Vices display a keen sense of situational awareness, often known for their “stalker-like” behavior, as they assess the Host’s emotions and situation to initiate a Branch at the most opportune time. Many Epsilons have the --gamma subclass and are able to communicate with their Host within the Branch Domain. Though, conversation is often limited to single words and broken sentences. Learn more about these abilities and the threats they can pose in <a href="./subclasses.html#gamma">Subclasses: --gamma</a>.</p>
                    <p>All Epsilons are born from a gradual advent. The complex emotions, sensations, and experiences that make up this period are responsible for the relatively complex Branch Policy. Simply put, the pool to pick from is quite large, and what may look like the whole picture could actually be only a fraction of it. Their large cores help to house the information for this complex Branch Policy.</p>
                    <p>Epsilon exhibitions tend to have hydra-like characteristics or multiple sets of limbs. They prefer to keep these appendages shrouded by long hair or dense feathers and only reveal them as a trump card when they have been cornered or are attempting dispersion. Epsilon Branch Domains are generally quite large to accommodate the larger exhibition, while maintaining details typically only observed in smaller domains. As the Vice matures, this domain can expand even further, revealing previously hidden areas often through doors, hallways, or physics-defying architecture. Epsilon exhibitions are also masters of camouflage and able to blend in with their Branch Domain despite their large stature.</p>
                    <p>Generally speaking, however, Epsilons are incredibly nonreactive. Larval Epsilons rarely initiate Branches, if ever, and mature Vices are more prone to lying in wait for the most opportune attack. Most Branch activity happens during early adolescence, when the Branch Policy is the least understood. While these consecutive Branches may feel like they provide enough information, if the Vice is allowed to mature or if rescission is pursued, it will reveal the full extent of its Branch Policy and likely surprise the Host in multiple ways.</p>
                    <p>An Epsilon’s network is established early in adolescence, when Branch activity is at its highest. Their complex networks result in highly-attuned stolons that monitor external conditions and can even detect specific phrases or tones of voice. With their well-established network, Epsilons are primed (though not guaranteed) to create or attempt to create a rumen at least once in its life cycle. This behavior is typically only observed in mature Vices.</p>

                        <h3>Larval</h3>
                    </div>
                    <p>Larval Epsilon Vices are extremely nonreactive, some going so far as to never initiate a Branch before adolescence. Because of this, Epsilons are extremely difficult to classify early on, and some even avoid detection altogether due to their gradual advent. Many discover their Epsilon Vice after the larval stage, only after other biological factors have been ruled out as cause for their inexplicable fatigue.</p>
                    <p>As a young Vice, Epsilons spend the majority of their time feeding. While they may not have the biological advantages of Zeta Vices, their abstaining from Branch initiation ensures full energy reserves going into adolescence. Because most Epsilons avoid initiating Branches during this stage, their Branch Policies have an unnaturally long incubation period, resulting in broad, complex policies.</p>
                    <p>Epsilon cores tend to be quite large, even during the larval stage. Those that have been documented display a density typically only observed in more mature Vices of other classifications.</p>
                    <h4>Rescission Guidance</h4>
                    <p>Because most Epsilon Vices avoid detection in the larval stage, there is not enough data on rescission during this stage to provide general guidelines. However, due to the higher threat level, it is recommended to pursue rescission alongside an established CVRS care team.</p>

                        <h3>Adolescent</h3>
                    </div>
                    <p>Many Hosts become aware of their Epsilon Vice once it reaches adolescence and begins initiating Branches. Because of their gradual advent and generally dormant larval stage, many Hosts misinterpret this initial Branch as the result of a Vice’s sudden advent and drastically underestimate the complexity of the Branch.</p>
                    <p>Upon first glance, adolescent Branch Domains are not terribly complex, but as time moves on, the domain can seem to expand at an alarming rate, especially at the Vice approaches maturity. This expansion typically takes place between Branches, but can be executed during production if lethally threatened. Because of its gradual advent, expansions to the domain may not make sense, with areas from different environments stitched together in physics-defying ways.</p>
                    <p>Epsilon exhibitions are hasty and do not hit hard, and like Delta Vices, they prey on frustration and disorientation, dragging out Branch times as they expertly evade attacks. Because they are still young, adolescents are less graceful and in-tune with their domain, but with time, the domain expansions along with their increasingly complex exhibition can begin to pose a real challenge.</p>
                    <p>Adolescent cores are quite dense, appearing as a large, white mass on a VGMS. At this stage, their network has begun establishing itself and is visible on a VGMS as well. Adolescent Epsilon networks are quite complex and well-established compared to most other adolescent classifications. Though the concept of networks have only recently been introduced to adolescent Epsilons, they tend to expand rapidly. After established, this network begins perfecting the feeding process to expertly allocate resources to various biological processes, even as an adolescent. Allowing an adolescent Epsilon Vice to mature can be lethal, as its well-established network and broad Branch Policy can mature into a truly formidable adult Vice.</p>
                    <h4>Rescission Guidance</h4>
                    <p>Because Branch activity halts almost completely in maturity, we highly recommend rescinding Epsilon Vices as adolescents. Adolescent domains are often disorienting and constantly expanding. A Solutions Architect will be able to provide a much needed overview of the domain layout, while a large team of Branch Administrators and Branch Coordinators can aid the Vice Management Administrator in tracking down the exhibition in a timely manner. No matter its age, when an Epsilon is cornered, it will begin to reveal previously hidden properties of its Branch Policy. In an active Branch, this includes expanding the Branch Domain’s blueprint, possibly unveiling additional appendages or heads of the exhibition, and even slightly altering its attack strategy. If a Vice feels it is being lethally threatened--especially in the instance of Branch instigation--it will unveil all of these properties, causing a drastic increase in complexity and risk. Building a strong, detail-focused, and quick-thinking team is imperative for success.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="timeline__stop">
                    <div class="heading-group">
                        <span class="superhead">Stage 3</span>
                        <h3>Mature</h3>
                    </div>
                    <p>Like many other classifications, Epsilon Vices tend to display heightened discernment in their maturity, and the rate of Branches decreases from adolescence. Mature Epsilons in particular become quite observant, utilizing their complex, well-established network to monitor internal and external conditions and choose the most effective time to initiate Branches.</p>
                    <p>Most mature Epsilons only initiate Branches under two circumstances: lethal threat and a clear line to a successful dispersion. Additionally, due to their widespread network, many Hosts are at risk of becoming berserk, as augmentation is easily pursued during active Branches. For this reason, we recommend rescinding Branches as quickly as possible.</p>
                    <p>Mature Epsilon cores tend to be quite dense, appearing as solid white on a VGMS, along with its established network. While most networks are relatively faint in comparison to the core, some high-traffic junctions in mature Epsilon networks can be almost as dense as the core itself. Because of this network, a Host with a mature Epsilon Vice is likely to have chronic drape and extrusion blights. Many seek treatment from a Blight Specialist to tame their symptoms.</p>
                    <p>While mature Epsilon exhibitions may have a similar attack strategy to Delta Vices in hiding throughout the domain, Epsilon are especially dangerous because they can also fight back once found. Additionally, their larger stature often requires multiple Adjuncts for backup, and previously hidden limbs or features can cause quite the challenge.</p>
                    <h4>Rescission Guidance</h4>
                    <p>While we recommend that Epsilon Vices be rescinded in the adolescent stage, we understand that one may not have the proper resources at their disposal. Rescinding a mature Epsilon Vice is extremely difficult, and building a care team in advance is imperative to success. Most Branches require multiple Adjuncts to both locate the elusive exhibition and attack it once found. Many Hosts are not bested in combat during a Branch; rather, they run out of time. Keeping a level head and staying alert are key at this life stage. Solutions Architects can provide a much-needed change in perspective, similar to their role with Delta Vices; however, due to their impressive camouflaging capabilities, some may still struggle with detecting them. Once the exhibition is found, Branch Administrators can provide the firepower to overwhelm the exhibition, though they may need backup.</p>

                    <!-- BRANCH POLICY -->
                    <h2>Branch Policy Properties</h2>
                    <p>The Branch Policy of Epsilon Vices tends to be quite complex. This is due in large part to their often long, drawn-out gradual advent. Epsilons are known for their ability to only reveal select properties of their Branch Policy. Many reveal these previously hidden properties when cornered or pursuing dispersion. Epsilons are extremely nonreactive, going so far as to avoid initiating Branches completely until adolescence. Because of this, many of the properties below only start to become known in adolescence. An Epsilon’s complex Branch Policy is not infinite, of course, and repeated attacks can force it to reveal all its cards. At a certain point, an Epsilon will have nothing left to reveal, but it is still best to operate with the assumption that at any given time, an Epsilon likely has something up its sleeve.</p>
                    <dl class="desc-list">
                        <dt>Environmental Branch Triggers(s)</dt>
                        <dd>Because of their longer gradual advent, the pool of experiences to choose from is quite large. Epsilons are able to “hide” many of these triggers, utilizing them during times of stress. Many mistake these Branches as “rogue”, which is inaccurate. Epsilons do not select properties outside of their established pool, as rogue Branches suggest; rather, the pool is simply so large that some of these triggers were simply not utilized until this time. Knowing the general time frame encompassed by the gradual advent can help Hosts prepare for future “reveals” of this property.</dd>
                        <dt>Branch Domain Blueprint</dt>
                        <dd>Epsilons are known for their complex Branch Domains. They are often disorienting in their architecture, and uncannily detailed when observed up close. As an Epsilon matures, it may deign to reveal previously hidden wings of their Branch Domain. These wings are often separate areas, stitched with the original domain using doors or hallways. Transitions between these wings can be confusing and unsettling, often placing Hosts and Adjuncts in unnatural positions once they fully cross over. Epsilons use these hidden wings to prolong Branch time and avoid capture.</dd>
                        <dt>Exhibition Presentation</dt>
                        <dd>Epsilon exhibitions are quite tall, typically towering over the average person. While they may have an impressive height, they are usually not bulky; though, due to large volumes of fur, feathers, and hair, their stature can still be quite imposing. Epsilons use their voluminous integuments to also conceal certain characteristics of their exhibitions. Many hide additional limbs, heads, or even wings and reveal these features when cornered or pursuing dispersion. For example, a cornered Epsilon exhibition may reveal a set of wings to evade combat, or a Vice that sees a line to dispersion may reveal a second set of limbs to enhance its combat abilities.</dd>

                        <dd>During production, Epsilon exhibitions generally avoid combat. Rather than perfecting evasion tactics like Delta Vices, as they reach maturity, Epsilon exhibitions become masters of camouflage. Their strategy is to essentially hide in plain sight and wait for the Host or Adjuncts to become frustrated, then attack. If an exhibition becomes cornered, they may reveal an additional wing of their Branch Domain to sew confusion, or they may reveal previously hidden features, as explored above.</dd>
                        <dt>Core Priorities</dt>
                        <dd>The lone property of an Epsilon’s Branch Policy that is not complex, Epsilons prioritize germination, simple as that. Epsilons use their camouflaging abilities in the Branch Domain to draw out Branch times, allowing for germination to occur. Their complex network not only helps them monitor conditions, but it also provides a clear path for augmentation once dispersion is being pursued. While chronic blights can be difficult to maintain, we recommend avoiding AVShots and Suppressants so no changes in behavior are missed.</dd>

                    <h2 class="mt-xl">Proposed Care Team</h2>
                    <p>While all Vices are different, the proposed care team below can give a general idea of the skills and equipment needed to properly address an Epsilon Vice.</p>
                    <dl class="desc-list">
                        <dt><a href="../../about/our-team/primary-care.html#VMA">Vice Management Administrator</a></dt>
                        <dd>These agents will construct a holistic, comprehensive understanding of the Vice and facilitate care accordingly. Vice Management Administrators are experts on your specific Vice’s behavior, meaning they can enlist the help of other agents where extra support may be needed.</dd>
                        <dt><a href="../../about/our-team/primary-care.html#solutions-architect">Solutions Architect</a></dt>
                        <dd>Because Epsilons are masters of camouflage, Solutions Architects typically focus on mapping the Branch Domain. As a pseudo Adjunct, an agent’s bird’s eye view can provide much-needed insight into the expanding and convoluted Branch Domain.</dd>
                        <dt><a href="../../about/our-team/primary-care.html#branch-admin">Branch Administrator</a></dt>
                        <dd>These agents are master wielders of their patch and can bring much-needed power in addressing an Epsilon Vice in an efficient and timely manner.</dd>
                        <dt><a href="../../about/our-team/primary-care.html#branch-coordinator">Branch Coordinator</a></dt>
                        <dd>Branch Coordinators are often enlisted to help search for the particularly elusive Epsilons within the Branch Domain, especially in maturity. Multiple agents are often enlisted to increase the odds to locating the exhibition quickly.</dd>
                        <dt><a href="../../about/our-team/primary-care.html#blight-specialist">Blight Specialist</a></dt>
                        <dd>Due to their extensive networks, Epsilon Vices often trigger chronic blights, which can be addressed and relieved by a resident Blight Specialist, if severe; though many forego treatment so as to not suppress the symptoms that communicate Vice activity. Blight Specialists, in this case, are often on standby to monitor blights and provide insight into possible changes in Vice activity.</dd>
