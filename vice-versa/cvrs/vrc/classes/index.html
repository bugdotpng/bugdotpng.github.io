                    <p>Receiving a professional classification is encouraged, as some Vices are known to be deceiving or are difficult to observe. While the classifications outlined below serve as a general guide for understanding these Vices, anomalies can and are likely occur. Please contact <a href="mailto:bugdotinfo@gmail.com">info@cvrs.com</a> with any anomalies, questions or concerns. Before diving into classifications, we recommend familiarizing yourself with <a href="../branches.html">The Branch Phenomenon</a> to establish a foundation in Branch mechanics.</p>
                    <h2>Threat Levels</h2>
                    <p>Vice classifications can be further categorized by their threat level, ranging from low to critical. This threat level informs Record Administrators and Vice Management Specialists on what materials or staff are needed for treatment and determines the probability for success.</p>
                    <div class="label-feature">
                        <div class="feature">
                            <span class="label">Low</span>
                            <p>Vices with a low threat level can often be rescinded without Adjuncts. Patches are recommended if planning to self-treat. If desired, Vices in this category can be treated with exposure rescission.</p>
                        </div>
                        <div class="feature">
                            <span class="label">Medium</span>
                            <p>Adjuncts are encouraged when addressing Vices with a medium threat level. Patches are also encouraged if planning to self-treat. Professional treatment via CVRS provides the highest chance of a successful rescission.</p>

                            <p>Multiple Adjuncts and patches are mandatory when addressing Vices with a high threat level. Self-treating is not advised. Establishing a CVRS care team early on is imperative to a successful rescission.</p>
                        </div>
                        <div class="feature">
                            <span class="label">Critical</span>
                            <p>Rescission is not guaranteed and is unlikely, regardless of Adjuncts, patches, and preparation. This threat level is reserved exclusively for Omega Vices.</p>
                        </div>
                    </div>
                    <h2>Primary Classifications</h2>
                    <p>Primary classes serve to inform Hosts of their Vice’s expected behavior. A Vice's classification is synonymous with its primary class. The classes outlined below each have their own page that goes into more detail and provides high-level guidance on approaching rescission. We recommend that all Hosts, regardless of their Vice’s threat level, seek counsel and treatment from a CVRS team.</p>
                    <p>Classification is not an instantaneous process. Multiple appointments and consultations with a Record Administrator may be required to perform accurate classification. Classifications may change in the early larval stage as they reveal more information, but anomalies at any stage are likely to occur. Some classifications are capable of deceit and restraint, making accurate classification difficult.</p>

                    <h3 class="has-label" id="alpha">Alpha <span class="label">Low</span></h3>
                    <p>Alpha Vices are the most common of the classifications, making up 65% of all Vices. These Vices are typically straightforward to treat due to their relatively predictable nature and lack of aggression. Alpha Vices are generally considered to be the initial pool from which all other Vices evolved and deviated. <a class="link" href="./alpha.html">Learn more about Alpha Vices.</a></p>
                    <h3 class="has-label" id="beta">Beta <span class="label">Medium</span></h3>
                    <p>Beta Vices are often viewed as the more intelligent, “evolved” version of Alpha Vices. Due to having a gradual advent, more aggressive blights, and a higher chance of rogue Branches, these Vices have a higher threat level than Alpha Vices. A Vice that shares all the qualities of an Alpha Vice but has a gradual advent is in all likelihood a Beta Vice and will show its true colors as it evolves. <a class="link" href="./beta.html">Learn more about Beta Vices.</a></p>
                    <h3 class="has-label" id="delta">Delta <span class="label">Low</span></h3>
                    <p>Delta Vices are a unique classification that can be tricky to treat, but ultimately pose little to no threat of dispersion. These timid Vices undergo the unique process of core “shedding” wherein the Vice abandons both the germination and augmentation progress made since advent or its last shed. Shedding resets the Vice’s Branch Policy and can even result in the Host’s memory loss. <a class="link" href="./delta.html">Learn more about Delta Vices.</a></p>
                    <h3 class="has-label" id="epsilon">Epsilon <span class="label">High</span></h3>
                    <p>Epsilon Vices are extremely difficult to treat due to their deceptive nature. While Δ!Vices shed their core and lose progress, Epsilon Vices keep their core and efficiently utilize their energy reserves--often using a rumen--to change their Branch Policy between Branches without warning. Epsilon Vices are one of the only classifications able to drastically change their exhibition. <a class="link" href="./epsilon.html">Learn more about Epsilon Vices.</a></p>
                    <h3 class="has-label" id="zeta">Zeta <span class="label">High</span></h3>
                    <p>Zeta Vices are one of the first Vices to display biological differences between other classifications. Zeta cores have a unique property of their epithelium that attracts hormones from throughout the body, allowing them to consistently feed. Because of this, Hosts with Zeta Vices tend to display visible signs of fatigue. Additionally, Zeta Vices have advanced storage capacity and are able to hoard more resources than the average Vice, in addition to having a penchant for establishing rumina. If allowed to mature, Zeta Vices can be extremely difficult to address due to their excessive energy reserves. <a class="link" href="./zeta.html">Learn more about Zeta Vices.</a></p>
                    <h3 class="has-label" id="theta">Theta <span class="label">Medium</span></h3>
                    <p>Theta Vices thrive on chaos and are notorious for their trademark explosive Branch after a period of sustained feeding. Θ!Vices have a wider-than-average staging radius and aim to admit as many tertiary Adjuncts as possible to this attempted dispersion. Though intimidating, these Vices can be easily addressed if caught early.Zeta Vices are one of the first Vices to display biological differences between other classifications.

                    <h3 class="has-label" id="lambda">Lambda <span class="label">High</span></h3>
                    <p>Lambda Vices are a relatively rare classification of Vice that deviates from all expected behavioral norms. Lambda Vices always have a sudden advent, but the Branch initiated at advent is leaps and bounds more complex than any other classification’s. Hosts with a Lambda Vice should be addressed by a Branch Administrator. If the Branch is addressed, future Branches will drastically decrease in severity. <a class="link" href="./lambda.html">Learn more about Lambda Vices.</a></p>
                    <h3 class="has-label" id="xi">Xi <span class="label">Medium</span></h3>
                    <p>Xi Vices are often misclassified as Α!Vices due to their relatively predictable early life. As these Vices mature, Branches become more complex, including exhibitions. While some tweaking to the Branch Policy between Branches is to be expected, the rate at which these properties evolve in Xi Vices can quickly become threatening. <a class="link" href="./xi.html">Learn more about Xi Vices.</a></p>
                    <h3 class="has-label" id="phi">Phi <span class="label">Low</span></h3>
                    <p>Phi Vices are a somewhat uncommon and bizarre classification of Vice that is so chaotic and dysfunctional in its makeup that it barely has enough energy to maintain its form&mdash;let alone the Branch initiated at its sudden advent. While these brittle Vices can easily be addressed, Hosts should remain vigilant, as the harboring of a Phi Vice indicates a susceptibility to infection that can result in contracting another Vice. <a class="link" href="./phi.html">Learn more about Phi Vices.</a></p>
                    <h3 class="has-label" id="omega">Omega <span class="label">Critical</span></h3>
                    <p>This extremely rare classification is often applied post-dispersion, as the properties of Omega Vices (Ω!Vices) tend to shift in ways that other classifications do not, often resulting in lethal misclassifications. The Omega classification is reserved for Vices that cannot be  categorized by any of the classifications outlined above, essentially acting as a fringe category of Vices. <a class="link" href="./omega.html">Learn more about Omega Vices.</a></p>
                    <h2 class="mt-xxl">Subclasses</h2>
                    <p>In certain cases, further classification may be applied to provide a more complete understanding of a Host’s Vice, called subclasses. Subclasses differ from primary classes in that they are unique behaviors or characteristics found in all Vices, regardless of primary classification. They typically are conerned with a single behavior, rather than a set of behaviors. Subclasses are a fairly new facet of Vice research, conducted primarily by Behavioral Analysts.</p>
                    <p>Subclasses are denoted with a leading double-hyphen and are always lowercase (e.g. Epsilon--gamma) and do not impact threat levels, though some can be unique to specific threat levels. Subclasses can also be stacked, for example: Epsilon--gamma--sigma.</p>
                    <h3>--gamma</h3>
                    <p>This relatively rare subclass if often applied post-dispersion, as Vices with the --gamma subclass seem to exhibit sentience and are, therefore, extremely difficult to rescind without the proper resources. Vices with this subclass have been known to observe and document its Host's behaviors, even going so far as being able to read thoughts and communicate with speech in the Branch Arena. Only Vices with a high or critical threat level are capable of having the --gamma subclass. <a href="./subclasses#gamma.html">Learn more about the --gamma subclass.</a></p>
                    <h3>--omicron</h3>
                    <p>--omicron Vices are capable of camouflaging their network. These Vices have evolved to emit a dense, neutralizing particle that engulfs both VN and VG and prevents them from being seen, even with Parsing Goggles. This technique is implemented as a way to lure Hosts into a false sense of security by keeping their network activity hidden. <a href="./subclasses#omicron.html">Learn more about the --omicron subclass.</a></p>
                    <h3>--sigma</h3>
                    <p>--sigma Vices have wider diet preferences, most commonly observed in, but not unique to, Zeta Vices. Where other Vices feed on hormones, --sigma Vices are much more permissive and feed on other bodily substances such as plasma or synovial fluid in addition to hormones. --sigma Vices typically have a gradual advent, are more likely to reach maturity, and are known for more complex and flexible Branch Policies. <a href="./subclasses#sigma.html">Learn more about the --sigma subclass.</a></p>
                    <h3>--rho</h3>
                    <p>While most Vices have a single, stationary core, --rho Vices have multiple, smaller cores throughout the Host’s body connected by an extremely dense network that often presents as stiff joints. This subclass typically accompanies Vices of a higher threat level and are often stacked with the --gamma subclass. All cores need to be destroyed in order for --rho Vices to be successfully rescinded. <a href="./subclasses#rho.html">Learn more about the --rho subclass.</a></p>
                    <h2>Class Evolution</h2>
                    <p>As stated in <a href="../biology.html#evolution">Evolution and Intelligence</a>, Vices continue to evolve at an alarming rate. As new behaviors are established, our Behavioral Analysts present possible classifications and sub-classifications to help prepare our agents.</p>
                    <p>It is understood that all Vices originated from Alpha Vices, with Beta, Xi, and Theta being the first classifications to Branch off. While it is relatively difficult to follow the exact path of evolution due to their reproductive method, the chart below gives us valuable insight into shared behaviors and can even aid in constructing plans of attack.</p>
                    <figure class="captioned-media">
                        <img class="border" src="../images/class-evolution.jpg" alt="A diagram showing the evolution of Vice classes. The top-most class is Alpha, with Xi, Beta, and Theta Vices branching off. Under the Xi class is Delta, Zeta, and Epsilon. Under epsilon is a line to Omega that reads 'proposed, unsure'.

                        <figcaption>The above chart shows the proposed order of Vice evolution. Due to the reproduction of Vices, the path of evolution is relatively difficult to follow and allows for new combinations of Vice classifications never before seen. We estimate the possibility of at least 5 new classifications in the coming year.</figcaption>
