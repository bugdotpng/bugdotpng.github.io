                        <p>This extremely rare classification is often applied post-dispersion, as the properties of Omega Vices tend to shift in unexpected, unprecedented ways that other classifications do not, often resulting in lethal misclassifications. The Omega classification is reserved for Vices that cannot be categorized by any of the other classifications, essentially acting as a fringe category of Vices.</p>

                    <p>Omega Vices most commonly resemble Epsilon Vices in their ability to withhold parts of their Branch Policy, though even experienced Vice Management Administrators have difficulty deciphering an Omega Vice’s Branch Policy, even after multiple Branches.</p>
                    <p>Exhibitions tend to be fairly consistent, but are often unbearably massive compared to most exhibitions and tend to evolve and grow at rates not observed in other Vices, sometimes even exceeding the limits of giga-exhibitions. Omega Vices have been known to scrap and rework exhibitions on a whim, displaying behaviors seen in Delta Vices, but what sets Omegas apart is their ability to do so within the Branch Domain during an active Branch.</p>
                    <p>Branch Domains range from being incredibly simple to maze-like and vividly complex, with some Omegas being able to change the Branch Domain during production, not unlike Epsilon Vices unveiling new “wings” of their domain. What sets Omegas apart, yet again, is their ability to do so during production.</p>
                    <p>Altering the Branch Domain and exhibition both entail copious amounts of energy, which is why it is often done outside of an active Branch. Omegas doing so in production suggests a level of intelligence and awareness that far exceeds the deceptive Epsilon and focused Xi Vices. Because of this, <a href="./subclasses.html#gamma">--gamma</a> subclasses always accompany Omega classifications. Where other --gamma Vices are restricted to single words or broken sentences, Omegas have been documented as carrying on full conversations with their Hosts and even any Adjuncts present. Some have even reported that their Vice has been able to speak to them outside of the Branch Domain, though this has proven difficult to replicate under a controlled environment. Hosts claim this speech is not through words, like they are in the Branch Domain, but through thoughts and suggestions, similar to intrusive thoughts.</p>
                    <p>While Omegas all seem to differ in their exhibition attack strategy, they are all quite conservative in initiating Branches. Much like mature Epsilon Vices, they seem to observe and wait for opportune times, rather than act on external stimuli or impulse. While it is possible to “trick” an Epsilon Vice into initiating a Branch, Omega Vices do not typically respond to threats, even those as direct as AV Shots. Likewise, in the Branch Domain, an Omega Vice can sustain incredible amounts of damage before terminating a Branch, drastically prolonging Branch times that aid in excessive germination and augmentation. For this reason, Omega networks are generally well-established, and often result in chronic blights, most commonly extrusion blights. </p>
                    <p>“Uncertainty” seems to be the unifying theme of Omega Vices, making this classification the most difficult Vice to treat. Features and behaviors vary so greatly between individual Vices that trying to outline similarities has proven to be futile. Many Omegas are initially incorrectly classified because of their greatly varying characteristics and behaviors. At the first sign of deviation from an established Branch Policy, please reach out to a Vice Management Administrator to begin treatment and observation.</p>
