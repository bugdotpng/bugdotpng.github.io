                    <p>Alpha Vices all share the following properties: 1) a sudden advent with a weak, but stable Branch initiation, 2) non-threatening blights, and 3) regular, predictable Branches with a transparent Branch Policy. This collection of properties typically results in straightforward treatment plans that involve observing early Branches in the adolescent phase and performing rescission in the adolescent stage before the Vice can mature. Alpha Vices rarely progress past the adolescent stage and only occasionally result in berserk Hosts, as their Branch Policies are easy to prepare for and their prioritization of core augmentation often result in a compromised core susceptible to attacks. Alpha Vices are typically classified in the late larval stage, roughly 4-6 months after advent.</p>

                        <h3>Larval</h3>
                    </div>
                    <p>In the larval stage, Alpha Vices are relatively calm, focusing primarily on feeding and storing VG for future Branches. Alpha Vices are likely to initiate to a small handful of exploratory Branches as they begin to establish their Branch Policy. These early Branches are quite predictable, as many of the properties found at advent are likely triggers. They tend to be less threatening and can be easily addressed with any patch, though many with an Alpha Vice do not manifest a patch until adolescence.</p>
                    <p>Larval exhibitions initially skew more defensive, but are inexperienced and reactive. They are easily spooked and can often be addressed using objects found in the Branch Arena if a patch is unavailable. Larval Alpha Vices are quick to concede with only minimal damage being applied to the core. Because of this, rescinding at this stage can be tricky, but can often be performed with brute force if appropriate.</p>
                    <h4>Rescission Guidelines</h4>
                    <p>While it may sound counter-intuitive, rescinding larval Alpha Vices tends to be more challenging than rescinding adolescents. Alpha cores are small and dense with a defensive exhibition in the few Branches they deign to initiate in the larval stage. It is recommended to spend the larval stage learning its Branch Policy and committing Branches until it matures to adolescence and has a less defensive exhibition with a larger, less dense core. If rescission must be pursued, we recommend doing so with a Vice Management Specialist.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="timeline__stop">
                    <div class="heading-group">
                        <span class="superhead">Stage 2</span>
                        <h3>Adolescent</h3>
                    </div>
                    <p>Alpha Vices exhibit a drastic increase in Branch activity during adolescence. The Branch Policy is solidified early in adolescence and is adhered to for the rest of its life cycle, with any changes being minor adjustments to the exhibition and Branch Arena. Adolescents tend to initiate Branches at every trigger, making it relatively easy to prepare for or even bait Branches. While other classifications often require a Bypass be used to instigate a Branch, adolescent Alpha Vices are so reactive and eager to initiate a Branch that a subtle change in environment to mirror the properties of advent can be enough to bait a Branch.</p>
                    <p>Alpha Vice cores are typically smaller than other classifications, leading to a smaller storage area for VG. Because of this, repeated Branches in succession are not likely, even if the proper conditions are met, leading to roughly 2-3 weeks of down time between Branches. Alpha Vices spend roughly 2 years in the adolescent stage and can initiate up to 30 Branches in this time.</p>
                    <p>As the Vice begins focus on network establishment in early adolescence, exhibitions begin skewing more offensive, receiving minor tweaks in between Branches to bolster its attack power. This comes at the expense of defense, resulting in what some may describe as a “glass cannon”. Due to the decrease in defense, rescission is more achievable, and blows to the core are more likely to be lethal compared to its more defensive larval stage.</p>
                    <h4>Rescission Guidelines</h4>
                    <p>When looking to rescind an Alpha Vice, doing so at the adolescent stage yields the most successful results. Alpha Vices begin to prioritize offense as they move into adolescence, often decreasing their defenses as a result. Because adolescents are so impulsive and reactive, pursuing rescission is recommended at this stage, as it is easy to take advantage of these characteristics and bait a Branch to pursue rescission on your own terms. While not integral to success, we always recommend pursuing rescission with at least a secondary Adjunct. Adolescents tend to ignore Adjuncts and primarily target the Host, often leading to a quick and efficient rescission if the Adjunct wields their patch well. Because adolescents have begun prioritizing augmentation, their core is much less dense and more susceptible to lethal blows. When a Vice is in the early stages of creating its network, the Host’s body is likely to establish a patch at this time, though it is not guaranteed.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="timeline__stop">
                    <div class="heading-group">
                        <span class="superhead">Stage 3</span>
                        <h3>Mature</h3>
                    </div>
                    <p>Many Alpha Vices do not make it to maturity, as the intelligence and discernment required to mature to this stage are not typically observed in their behavior. Alpha Vices that have been allowed to mature tend to show a bit more restraint than in adolescence. Though, mature Alpha Vices are still considered impulsive and do not display as much discernment in initiating Branches as those with a higher threat level do; however, they are less likely to be baited into Branches, and a Bypass will need to be used to instigate a Branch when pursuing rescission.</p>
                    <p>Mature exhibitions have fully prioritized offense and are typically at the larger end of meso-exhibitions at around five feet tall. The primary difference between adolescent and mature Alpha Vices in the Branch Arena lies in its power. Rescission is still likely if the proper preparations are made. Adjuncts are recommended at this stage, as it is relatively easy to overwhelm them with multiple extensions in the Branch Arena.</p>
                    <h4>Rescission Guidelines</h4>
                    <p>While most Alpha Vices do not make it to maturity, the same strategy used for rescinding adolescents can also be applied to mature Vices. The primary difference between the two stages lies in the Vice’s increase in power, though with a dedicated team of Adjuncts, rescission should be just as achievable. Mature Alpha Vices do still tend to target the Host in the Branch Arena and can be distracted or even overwhelmed by multiple primary or secondary Adjuncts. Due to the prioritization of augmentation, mature cores tend to be larger, but are still relatively vulnerable during Branches. Due to the increase in offense, we recommend enlisting the help of a Vice Management Specialist before pursuing rescission.</p>

                    <!-- BRANCH POLICY -->
                    <h2>Branch Policy Properties</h2>
                    <p>Alpha Vices are known for their strict adherence to their established Branch Policy. As an Alpha Vice evolves, only its Branch Arena blue print and exhibition presentation are liable to change, though this is typically only observed as increased complexity, which is common in all classifications. The properties explored below are generalizations and are not guaranteed to apply to every Alpha Vice.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Environmental Branch Triggers(s)</strong><br/>All Alpha Vices have a sudden advent, making for straightforward and predictable Branch triggers. While all properties of advent can be used as triggers, Alpha Vices tend to favor smells and specific seasonal indicators, such as a heat wave or sudden thunderstorm.</li>
                        <li><strong>Branch Arena Blueprint</strong><br/>Due to their sudden advent, Alpha Branch Arenas tend to be relatively simple, often consisting of a single room or “stage”. Because of this, Alpha staging times are generally shorter than those of other classifications. Details of the Branch Arena start out as fuzzy and vague, and increase in sharpness and clarity with maturity.</li>
                        <li><strong>Exhibition Presentation</strong></br>Alpha exhibitions are typically between two and five feet tall, most commonly hovering around 3’6”. Because they generally prioritize offense, they often have a stronger upper body and share characteristics with common mammalian predators, such as dogs, wolves, and big cats. Over time, its offensive features are likely to be emphasized, leading to larger teeth and claws.</li>
                        <li><strong>Exhibition Attack Strategy</strong></br>Alpha exhibitions are generally offensive and mimic the hunting habits of the mammalian predators they often resemble. This leads to many engaging in a sort of “stalking” behavior before attacking. Alpha exhibitions prioritize attack, but often leave themselves vulnerable in the process by coming into close range of the Host or Adjuncts. Alpha cores are also highly reactive and typically terminate Branches after the core has received minimal damage.</li>
                        <li><strong>Core Priorities</strong><br/>Alpha cores tend to prioritize core augmentation over germination, often resulting in vulnerable cores that are extremely susceptible to damage from successful commits.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h2>Proposed Care Team</h2>
                    <p>While all Vices are different, the proposed care team below can give a general idea of the skills and equipment needed to properly address an Alpha Vice.</p>
                    <dl class="desc-list">
                        <dt><a href="../../about/our-team/primary-care.html#vms">Vice Management Specialist</a></dt>
                        <dd>These agents will construct a holistic, comprehensive understanding of the Vice and facilitate care accordingly. Vice Management Specialists are experts on your specific Vice’s behavior, meaning they can enlist the help of other agents where extra support may be needed.</dd>
                        <dt><a href="../../about/our-team/primary-care.html#vmc">Vice Management Coordinator</a></dt>
                        <dd>These agents are often enlisted to help Vice Management Specialists keep track of Vice details and provide extra firepower in the Branch Arena, if necessary.</dd>
                    </dl>
                    <h2 class="mt-lg">Misclassifications</h2>
                    <p>Because all classifications originated from Alpha Vices, many are erroneously classified as Alpha Vices before their true nature is observed. Xi and Theta Vices in particular bear a striking resemblance to Alpha Vices in their early larval stage, but begin to deviate into their own as they mature. Paying close attention to their feeding habits and Branch Policy in the larval stage will help alert you of any potential deviations. Notify your Vice Management Specialist of any changes in behavior immediately, as this can give agents a leg up in an otherwise tricky situation and avoid being surprised by rogue Branches.</p>
                    <p>Xi Vices have an unnaturally active larval stage wherein they tend to initiate more Branches than the average Vice, let alone the relatively docile Alpha Vice. Vices with a sudden advent and tame blights, but a difficult-to-follow or impulsive Branch Policy is likely a Xi Vice.</p>
                    <p>Theta Vices and Alpha Vices share a near-identical, feeding-focused larval stage punctuated with a handful of exploratory Branches. Though, as Theta Vices progress to the adolescent stage and begin to establish their network, they tend to stay focused on feeding in preparation for their explosive rogue Branch. If a supposed Alpha Vice has begun building its network but has not initiated any Branches, contact your Vice Management Specialist immediately.</p>
