                    <p>Alpha Vices are known for their sudden advent with a weak, but stable Branch initiation. As they mature, they have non-threatening blights and regular, predictable Branches with a transparent Branch Policy. This collection of properties typically results in straightforward treatment plans that involve observing early Branches in the adolescent phase and performing rescission in the adolescent stage before the Vice can mature. Alpha Vices rarely progress past the adolescent stage and only occasionally result in berserk Hosts, as their Branch Policies are easy to prepare for and their prioritization of core augmentation often result in a compromised core susceptible to attacks. Alphas are typically classified in the early to mid larval stage, roughly 2-3 weeks after advent.</p>
                    <p>Because Alphas prioritize augmentation before germination, blight activity is generally quite rare before late adolescence; though, an expulsion blight is likely to manifest in the late larval or early adolescent stage, as it does not require a network to function.</p>
                    <p>Both blight activity and Branch activity are not used in determining the initial classification; instead, they are used to look for misclassifications. Theta and Xi Vices are commonly misclassified as Alphas in their early life stages due to their similarities.

                        <h3>Larval</h3>
                    </div>
                    <p>In the larval stage, Alpha Vices are relatively calm, focusing primarily on feeding and storing VG for future Branches. While not terribly active, they can still be expected to initiate a small handful of exploratory Branches. These early Branches are quite predictable, as many of the properties found at advent are likely triggers, and Branch Domains remain quite simple. They tend to be less threatening and can be easily addressed with any patch, though patches often do not manifest until adolescence. Objects found in the Branch Domain and even manual combat are perfectly suitable alternatives to a patch and can easily overwhelm a larval Alpha exhibition.</p>
                    <p>Young Alpha exhibitions are inexperienced and reactive. They are quick to concede with only minimal damage being applied to the core. Because of this, rescinding at this stage can be tricky, but can often be performed with brute force, if needed.</p>
                    <p>Expulsion blights tend to manifest shortly before adolescence, signaling the attempted advancement of the Vice core.</p>
                    <h4>Rescission Guidance</h4>
                    <p>While it may sound counter-intuitive, rescinding larval Alpha Vices tends to be more challenging than rescinding adolescents. Alpha cores are small and dense, making it difficult to land accurate blows without trigger the premature termination of a Branch. It is recommended to spend the larval stage learning its Branch Policy and committing Branches until it matures to adolescence and has a larger, less dense core. If rescission must be pursued, we recommend doing so with a Vice Management Specialist.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="timeline__stop">
                    <div class="heading-group">
                        <span class="superhead">Stage 2</span>
                        <h3>Adolescent</h3>
                    </div>
                    <p>Branch activity increases drastically in adolescence, greatly limiting the time between Branches. Adolescents tend to initiate Branches at every possible trigger established at advent, making it relatively easy to prepare for or even bait Branches. While other classifications often require a Bypass be used to instigate a Branch, adolescent Alphas are so reactive and eager to initiate a Branch that a subtle change in environment to mirror the properties of advent can be enough to bait a Branch.</p>
                    <p>Repeated Branches often trigger the manifestation of a patch in early adolescence as the Host’s body adjusts to the increase in Branch activity.</p>
                    <p>While most adolescent Vices prioritize germination before augmentation, adolescent Alphas stay true to their impulsivity and pursue augmentation at every possible instance. Because of this unbiased prioritization, adolescent Alpha cores tend to stretch and become less dense. They are often brittle and much more susceptible to lethal attacks in the Branch Domain compared to their larval counterparts.</p>
                    <p>As adolescent Alphas pursue augmentation, blights often become agitated, resulting in repeated instances of acute blights. This differs from chronic blights, in that these individual instances only last for short bursts of time, up to two days at most; whereas chronic blights can last for months at a time.</p>
                    <h4>Rescission Guidance</h4>
                    <p>When looking to rescind an Alpha Vice, doing so at the adolescent stage yields the most successful results. Because adolescent Alphas are so impulsive and reactive, pursuing rescission is recommended at this stage, as it is easy to take advantage of these characteristics and bait a Branch to pursue rescission on your own terms, when the proper resources have been gathered. While not integral to success, we always recommend pursuing rescission with at least one secondary Adjunct. Adolescents tend to ignore Adjuncts and primarily target the Host, often leading to a quick and efficient rescission if the Adjunct wields their patch well. Because adolescents have begun prioritizing augmentation, their core is much less dense and more susceptible to lethal blows.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="timeline__stop">
                    <div class="heading-group">
                        <span class="superhead">Stage 3</span>
                        <h3>Mature</h3>
                    </div>
                    <p>Many Alphas do not make it to maturity, as the intelligence and discernment required to mature to this stage are not typically exercised. Alphas that have been allowed to mature tend to show a bit more restraint than in adolescence. Though, mature Alphas are still considered impulsive and do not display as much discernment in initiating Branches as those with a higher threat level do; however, they are less likely to be baited into Branches, and a Bypass will need to be used to instigate a Branch when pursuing rescission.</p>
                    <p>Mature exhibitions are typically at the larger end of meso-exhibitions at around five feet tall. The primary difference between adolescent and mature Alpha Vices in the Branch Domain lies in its power. Rescission is still likely if the proper preparations are made. Adjuncts are recommended at this stage, as it is relatively easy to overwhelm them with multiple extensions in the Branch Domain.</p>
                    <h4>Rescission Guidance</h4>
                    <p>While most Alphas do not make it to maturity, the same strategy used for rescinding adolescents can also be applied to mature Vices. The primary difference between the two stages lies in the Vice’s increase in power, though with a dedicated team of Adjuncts, rescission should be just as achievable. Mature Alphas do still tend to target the Host in the Branch Domain and can be distracted or even overwhelmed by multiple primary or secondary Adjuncts. Due to the prioritization of augmentation, mature cores tend to be larger, which are able to fuel their power, but are still relatively vulnerable during Branches.</p>

                    <h2>Branch Policy Properties</h2>
                    <p>Alphas are known for their strict adherence to their established Branch Policy. The properties explored below are generalizations and are not guaranteed to apply to every Alpha Vice.</p>
                    <dl class="desc-list">
                        <dt>Environmental Branch Triggers(s)</dt>
                        <dd>An Alpha’s sudden advent results in straightforward and predictable Branch triggers. Alphas tend to favor smells and specific seasonal indicators, such as a heat wave or sudden thunderstorm; though, they are often not terribly picky in the triggers they choose to act on. Adolescent Alphas are known for their impulsivity and reactivity.</dd>
                        <dt>Branch Domain Blueprint</dt>
                        <dd>Due to their sudden advent, Alpha Branch Domains tend to be relatively simple, often consisting of a single room or “stage”. Because of this, Alpha staging times are generally shorter than those of other classifications. Details of the Branch Domain start out as fuzzy and vague, and increase in sharpness and clarity with maturity, though they rarely increase in complexity.</dd>
                        <dt>Exhibition Presentation</dt>
                        <dd>Alpha exhibitions are typically between two and five feet tall, most commonly hovering around the higher end. Because they generally prioritize offense, they often have a stronger upper body and share characteristics with common mammalian predators, such as dogs, wolves, and big cats. Over time, its offensive features are likely to be emphasized, leading to larger teeth and claws.</dd>
                        <dt>Exhibition Attack Strategy</dt>
                        <dd>Alpha exhibitions are generally offensive and mimic the hunting habits of the mammalian predators they often resemble. This leads to many engaging in a sort of “stalking” behavior before attacking. Alpha exhibitions prioritize attack, but often leave themselves vulnerable in the process by coming into close range of the Host or Adjuncts. Alpha cores are also highly reactive and typically terminate Branches after the core has received minimal damage.</dd>
                        <dt>Core Priorities</dt>
                        <dd>Alpha cores tend to prioritize core augmentation over germination, often resulting in vulnerable cores that are extremely susceptible to damage from successful commits.</dd>

                    <p>While all Vices are different, the proposed care team below can give a general idea of the skills and equipment needed to properly address an Alpha Vice.</p>
                    <dl class="desc-list">
                        <dt><a href="../../about/our-team/primary-care.html#vms">Vice Management Specialist</a></dt>
                        <dd>These agents will construct a holistic, comprehensive understanding of the Vice and facilitate care accordingly. Vice Management Specialists are experts on your specific Vice’s behavior, meaning they can enlist the help of other agents where extra support may be needed.</dd>
                        <dt><a href="../../about/our-team/primary-care.html#vmc">Vice Management Coordinator</a></dt>
                        <dd>These agents are often enlisted to help Vice Management Specialists keep track of Vice details and provide extra firepower in the Branch Domain, if necessary.</dd>
                    </dl>
                    <h2 class="mt-lg" id="misclassifications">Misclassifications</h2>
                    <p>Because all classifications originated from Alpha Vices, many are erroneously classified as Alphas before their true nature is observed. <a href="./xi.html">Xi</a> and <a href="./theta.html">Theta</a> Vices in particular bear a striking resemblance to Alpha Vices in their early larval stage, but begin to deviate into their own as they mature.</p>
                    <p>Especially in adolescence, Theta Vices are more concerned with establishing their network, and Xi Vices begin to enhance their Branch Policy to a degree never observed in Alphas. Adolescent Theta Branch activity is often much higher than that of adolescent Alphas, and Xis tend to exhibit a thoughtful, calculated approach in the Branch Domain that contrasts greatly with Alphas’ impulsivity and lack of tact.</p>
                    <p>Familiarizing yourself with the subtle differences between these classifications can help lead to proper classifications and avoid allowing Vices to mature into something unmanageable.</p>
