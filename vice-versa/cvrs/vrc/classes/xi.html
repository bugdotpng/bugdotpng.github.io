                        <p>Lambda Vices are a relatively rare classification of Vice that deviates from all expected behavioral norms. Lambda Vices always have a sudden advent, but the Branch initiated at advent is leaps and bounds more complex than any other classification’s. Hosts with a Lambda Vice should be addressed by a Branch Administrator. If the Branch is addressed, future Branches will drastically decrease in severity.</p>

                    <p>Aside from Omega Vices, Xi Vices are the most commonly misclassified, even in later stages. Because of their relatively mundane early life stages, many are incorrectly classified as Alpha Vices, but when their Branch Policy inevitably evolves, they are sometimes reclassified incorrectly as an Epsilon Vice. What sets them apart from Epsilons is that there is no deception involved. Instead, what happens between Branches is the evolution of the Branch Policy. The general properties stay roughly the same, but they increase in severity. For this reason, they are often regarded as the opposite of Lambda Vices. Learn more about these changes in <a href="#branch-policy">Branch Policy Properties</a> below.</p>
                    <p>In their early life stages, Xi Vices are quite manageable. Because of their sudden advent, their Branch Policy is straightforward. Their Branch Domains are simple, and their exhibitions can easily be countered. But if they are allowed to mature, these properties can evolve out of control to the point where exhibitions are expertly crafted combat machines that use every square inch of their Branch Domains to their advantage.</p>
                    <p>The majority of a Xi’s energy between Branches is directed toward enhancing their Branch Policy, but during Branches, they use their heightened intelligence to assess the optimum place to direct their resources. Most Vices use Branches as an opportunity to gain augmentation and germination progress, but in early stages, Xi will instead use Branches to document Host and Adjunct behavior, essentially “taking notes” on how to improve their strategy for future Branches. Once they recognize the Host is having trouble in the Branch Domain, they will then begin to make germination progress, and later augmentation progress. Like Theta Vices, adolescent Xi networks are relatively sparse, but they become established throughout the body much quicker.</p>
                    <p>While it may not seem like it, even in its early stages, a Xi Vice is documenting, observing, and assessing every piece of data it can gather. As the Host, it is imperative to repay it with the same level of meticulous attention. Pay special attention to a Xi’s Branch Policy, even in the larval and adolescent stage. At the first sign of heightened optimization, contact a Vice Management Administrator.</p>

                        <h3>Larval</h3>
                    </div>
                    <p>Larval Xi Vices are almost indistinguishable from Alpha Vices. Their sudden advent and predictable Branches often lead to an incorrect initial classification. Hosts are likely not at risk during this stage, but as the Vice matures, enhancements will begin to be made to the Branch Policy.</p>
                    <p>Like Alpha larvae, Xi larvae aren’t terribly responsive and are likely to only initiate a few Branches during this life stage. Within the Branch Domain, they also share a similar core reactivity, Both Alpha and Xi larvae tend to retreat at the first sign of damage.</p>
                    <p>Perhaps the only distinguishing characteristic between larval Xi and Alpha Vices is their exhibition and its behavior in the Branch Domain. They are often roughly the same size, though Alpha Vices tend to have more established offensive characteristics, such as horns and claws; whereas, Xi features are often dulled. Alpha exhibitions are more impulsive in the Branch Domain and prone to attack, while Xi exhibitions seem more way, as if they are gauging the Host’s abilities before it attacks.</p>
                    <p>Paying attention to these behaviors in the select Branches initiated during the larval stage can lead to a proper classification and prompt rescission after gathering the appropriate team.</p>
                    <h4>Rescission Guidance</h4>
                    <p>At this stage, rescinding a Xi Vice is relatively straightforward, perhaps even more straightforward than larval Alpha rescission. Because their exhibition is less defensive and more balanced, inflicting lethal damage is generally achievable. However, their core reactivity is quite high, and any inaccurate blows can cause the Branch to be terminated before the core is destroyed. For this reason, we recommend establishing care with a Vice Management Administrator.</p>

                        <span class="superhead">Stage 2</span>
                        <h3>Adolescent</h3>
                    </div>
                    <p>Adolescence is when many Hosts begin to experience the enhancement of the Vice’s Branch Policy. Like most adolescent Vices, Branch activity begins to pick up in this stage. And like Alpha Vices, they show no discernment in initiating Branches; however, as explored below, certain aspects of the Branch Policy begin to evolve during this stage. Exhibitions become more honed for combat and begin better using their Branch Domain, which has slowly become more detailed and aids in both hiding the exhibition and causing the Host to become distracted or overwhelmed.</p>
                    <p>As mentioned previously, deception is not part of a Xi’s strategy. They are simply using the data they have gathered to better enhance their chances in the Branch Domain. Short Branch times result in a tweaked Branch Policy, while longer Branch times begin to prompt germination.</p>
                    <p>Xi adolescents aren’t known for any one behavior or ability. More than anything, they adapt to counter the Host, leading to some minor discrepancies in the timing of biological developments. Depending on a Host’s ability, one adolescent may have a sparse, but established network, while another can have barely one at all. Xi adolescents use this phase of elevated Branch activity to learn everything they can about their Host. If allowed to mature, they can become expertly-crafted combat machines evolved specially to counter their Host, making for longer Branch times and difficult rescission. For this reason, we recommend rescinding a Xi Vice at this stage, if possible.</p>
                    <h4>Rescission Guidance</h4>
                    <p>Adolescent Xi rescission tends to vary in difficulty between individual Hosts. Vices with more established networks and larger cores are larger threats than those still attempting to find their footing. Regardless, it is imperative to rescind a Xi Vice at this stage and to prevent it from reaching maturity. Many Hosts manifest their patch during this stage, which can prove extremely helpful in catching the meticulous Vice off guard. Adding Adjuncts can also swing Branches in the Host’s favor.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="timeline__stop">
                    <div class="heading-group">
                        <span class="superhead">Stage 3</span>
                        <h3>Mature</h3>
                    </div>
                    <p>Some mature Xi Vices can match the threat levels of Epsilon and Zeta Vices. Regardless of where they are at in adolescence, it does not take a Xi long to learn their Host’s behaviors. These Vices have perfected their observational abilities, and after one or two Branches in maturity, these Vices can begin to greatly prolong Branch times, leading to more augmentation and germination progress.</p>
                    <p>Mature Xis tend to have denser networks, making chronic blights more likely. Blight Specialists can closely observe this blight activity and preemptively warn Hosts of any exhibition enhancements between Branches.</p>
                    <p>Mature Xi domains are roughly the same size as those in adolescence, but they are substantially more detailed to an almost disorienting degree. Many Hosts claim they find it difficult to concentrate or focus during Branches, as the detailed environment can be overstimulating.</p>
                    <p>Mature Xis are not indestructible, however, as leaning heavily on their data sets allows them to be easily caught off guard by surprises, such as adding new secondary Adjuncts or instigating a Branch. Doing so will likely result in an enraged exhibition upon entry to the Branch Domain and should be accounted for in advance.</p>
                    <h4>Rescission Guidance</h4>
                    <p>Similar to adolescent Xis, mature Xis tend to vary in difficulty, though they should all be treated with the same degree of respect. After they feel comfortable doing so, most Vice Management Administrators will instigate a Branch with the intent of rescission and enlist multiple new Adjuncts. Often, the combination of instigation and new Adjuncts are enough to throw the Vice off its balance, which can often be easily overwhelmed with a few Branch Coordinators or Branch Administrator.</p>

                    <h2 id="branch-policy">Branch Policy Properties</h2>
                    <p>Thanks to their sudden advent, Xi Branch Policies tend to be quite straightforward, often leading to misclassification as an Alpha Vice. If allowed to mature, these properties do not change, but they will increase in efficiency, gradually raising the risk with each new Branch. The properties explored below are generalizations and are not guaranteed to apply to every Xi Vice.</p>
                    <dl class="desc-list">
                        <dt>Environmental Branch Triggers(s)</dt>
                        <dd>Xi Branch triggers pull from its sudden advent, but tend to be generally vague. What starts out a a seemingly straightforward trigger can morph over time into something more broad, only tangentially related to the original trigger. Xis tend to favor less concrete triggers, such as emotions, or triggers with many potential deviations, such as songs. For example, if a specific song was playing at advent, its subsequent trigger could encompass songs by that same artist or songs that use instruments in a similar way.</dd>
                        <dt>Branch Domain Blueprint</dt>
                        <dd>Xi Branch Domains start out generally large, but quite simple, often pulling from the environment present during advent. At a glance, the Branch Domain seems to mimic advent, but when observed up close, details become fuzzy. As the Vice matures, these details begin to fill in, eventually resulting in a perfect replica of the advent environment. Xi Vices intend to use this to their advantage, hoping the increase in details prompt emotional distress or inaction.</dd>
                        <dt>Exhibition Presentation</dt>
                        <dd>Young Xi exhibitions are generally nonthreatening, lacking prominent features like claws, fangs, or horns. Any horns present tend to be dulled, and claws or fangs are often short. As they mature, however, these features can become much more imposing between Branches as they grow larger and sharper. Their initially lean bodies often gain excessive bulk or harden existing scales.</dd>
                        <dt>Exhibition Attack Strategy</dt>
                        <dd>Xis are among one of the only classifications to have balanced exhibitions, meaning no one attack strategy is favored. Xi are observant and adaptable, able to modify their strategies to best suit the situation at hand. In one Branch they may focus on attack, while they avoid combat in the next. Because of their strict data collection, Xi Vices do not like surprises. The introduction of a patch or the addition of a new Adjunct are easy ways to throw a Xi off balance, no matter its life stage.</dd>
                        <dt>Core Priorities</dt>
                        <dd>The entirety of a Lambda’s existence is poured into its advent, starting off strong to hit as hard as possible. If a Host has the proper resources to address this initial Branch, the Vice typically does not have the biology established to maintain its hard-hitting Branch Policy, resulting in its devolution over time. Though, if a Host is unable to gather the proper resources prior to advent, dispersion is likely, resulting in this classification’s high threat level.</dd>
                    </dl>
                    <h2 class="mt-xl">Proposed Care Team</h2>
                    <p>While all Vices are different, the proposed care team below can give a general idea of the skills and equipment needed to properly address a Xi Vice.</p>
                    <dl class="desc-list">
