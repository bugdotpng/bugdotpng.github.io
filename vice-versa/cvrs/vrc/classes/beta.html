Due to having a gradual advent, more aggressive blights, and a higher chance of rogue Branches, these Vices have a higher threat level than Alpha Vices.

                    <p>Beta Vices were the first classification to deviate from Alpha Vices, due in large part to the introduction of gradual advents. The complexity of gradual advents led to Vices with more aggressive blights and a higher propensity for what many mistake as “rogue” Branches. These Branches are not so much “rogue” as they are simply Branches pulling from a broad collection of environmental triggers established during the Vice’s gradual advent.</p>
                    <p>Beta Vices prioritize germination, resulting in more Branches throughout its life cycle. Because their broad pool of triggers is difficult to prepare for in early stages, Beta Vices result in berserk Hosts more often than Alpha Vices. More mature Beta Vices use their complex, well-established network to pave the way for extremely thorough augmentation prior to dispersion.</p>
                    <p>While these Vices have a higher threat level than Alpha Vices, they are no more intelligent or crafty in the creation of their Branch Policy. The key to addressing Beta Vices lies in unraveling its complex environmental Branch triggers, which can then be bested by maintaining composure and applying brute force. Beta Vices rely on catching Hosts off guard rather than prioritizing complex arenas and exhibitions.</p>

                        <h3>Larval</h3>
                    </div>
                    <p>Beta Vices can be somewhat active in their larval stage, but are generally considered tame compared to Vices of the same threat level. Due to their gradual advent, the Branch Policy of a Beta Vice is often difficult to pin down during the larval stage, leading to a broad, seemingly disconnected collection of environmental Branch triggers.</p>
                    <p>In anticipation of their germination as they mature, larval Beta Vices generally feed more than Alpha Vices and are more skilled at ensnaring passing hormones due to biological deviations. While Alpha Vices tend to have a smooth core, the epithelium around larval Beta cores are wispy, almost hairy, displaying what are essentially rudimentary network tracks. This causes them to appear somewhat fuzzy on a VGMS. While this fuzziness is found in other classifications, this significantly narrows down the options, leading to a faster classification time of roughly 2-3 months after a successful VGDS.</p>
                    <p>Beta exhibitions tend to lean more hasty than Alpha Vices and are generally regarded as relatively balanced. Cores are also less reactive, though due to their “hairy” epithelium, they are more discerning in their retreat, using these fuzzy proto-tracks as a gauge to make more informed decisions. Even if a larval Beta core is not hit directly, but its epithelium senses and processes the attack as something life-threatening, it will terminate the Branch prematurely.</p>
                    <h4>Rescission Guidelines</h4>
                    <p>Because larval Beta exhibitions are less defensive than those of Alpha Vices, rescission at this stage is encouraged. Larval Beta cores are still quite reactive, so accuracy, efficiency and power are all imperative when wielding a patch. After classification, establishing a CVRS care team is imperative to success. Allowing a Beta Vice to mature can be dangerous, as the exhibition will only become more threatening with time, and the network will quickly grow in complexity, tempting the Vice to initiate more Branches in attempts to pursue dispersion. The varied arsenal of patches available from CVRS agents can aid in addressing a larval Beta Vice quickly and efficiently.</p>

                    <div class="timeline__stop">
                    <div class="heading-group">
                        <span class="superhead">Stage 2</span>
                        <h3>Adolescent</h3>
                    </div>
                    <p>While most adolescent Vices are generally impulsive and rambunctious, adolescent Beta Vices tend to be even more so, eager to pursue a more complex network or capitalize on a recently-expanded network. Due to its gradual advent, the environmental Branch triggers can be relatively difficult to pin down. Beta Vices take advantage of this ambiguity by initiating Branches often, using different combinations of Branch triggers so as to avoid the Host accurately predicting Branches. Additionally, adolescent Beta Vices use the time the Host spends on orienting themself at the beginning of the Branch to establish and then greatly expand their network.</p>
                    <p>Because of these established networks, many Hosts exhibit severe acute blights during Branches and chronic drape blights between Branches. A Vice Management Specialist is likely to prescribe daily Suppressants to provide relief, while performing rigorous VGMS between Branches to monitor Vice behavior.</p>
                    <p>Adolescent Beta exhibitions are generally hasty, prioritizing characteristics that allow the exhibition to easily evade attacks or conceal oneself among the arena. Relying on the more complex Branch Arenas that result from a gradual advent, adolescent Beta exhibitions are often a product of their environment, having characteristics that enable them to efficiently interact with the arena. These characteristics may not have been present in the larval stage.</p>
                    <p>Adolescent Beta cores tend to shed the fuzzy epithelium found in the larval stage in favor of its more advanced and efficient network. As the network expands, the core is likely to expand with it, often leading to larger, more fragile cores susceptible to attacks. Regular AVShots can be used to both tame excessive germination and damage the core, though they do risk instigating rogue Branches.</p>
                    <h4>Rescission Guidelines</h4>
                    <p>Rescinding adolescent Beta Vices is generally straightforward, especially when the Branch is initiated on the Host’s time as a result of instigation, rather than trying to orient oneself in an unexpected Branch where the Vice has the upper hand. Because these Vices have performed core augmentation as a sort of “afterthought” of germination, adolescent Beta cores are generally quite fragile and are more susceptible to lethal blows due to their broader surface area. Because of this, Beta Vices require a less complex care team in adolescence, and most patches established by the Host are well-suited for its exhibition.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="timeline__stop">
                    <div class="heading-group">
                        <span class="superhead">Stage 3</span>
                        <h3>Mature</h3>
                    </div>
                    <p>Because Beta Vices prioritize germination so heavily during adolescence, they begin to exhibit a dangerous intentionality in maturity. Augmentation is less of an afterthought and pursued thoughtfully, resulting in denser, less fragile cores. Because of their established networks, mature Beta Vices are likely to create rumina and better survey the environment with stolons to initiate more intentional Branches and take advantage of high-stress situations to catch the Host off guard with lethal rogue Branches.</p>
                    <p>By this time, a Host is likely to have outlined the broad array of environmental Branch triggers, but the Vice has often begun prioritizing other facets of its Branch Policy, namely perfecting its exhibition and Branch Arena blueprint. Mature Beta exhibitions are extremely in-tune with their Branch Arena and are able to utilize the environment to bolster their attack, defense, and evasion strategies equally. Even if a Host is able to predict and prepare for a Branch, they often have trouble both defending against and attacking a mature Beta exhibition.</p>
                    <h4>Rescission Guidelines</h4>
                    <p>Because their cores are less fragile, mature Beta Vices require a care team similar in composition to its larval stage, with a focus on power. The threat of mature Beta exhibitions does not necessarily lie in their intelligence, but rather in their efficiency and confidence. Though their calculated and methodical attacks can be intimidating in the Branch Arena, their attack strategies are not complex and can generally be bested with brute force, typically with the help of a Branch Administrator.</p>

                    <!-- BRANCH POLICY -->
                    <h2>Branch Policy Properties</h2>
                    <p>Beta Vices are known for their broad array of environmental Branch triggers, leading many to believe they do not have a firmly established Branch Policy. This is not true, as all Vices adhere to their Branch Policies established by advent. The most complex facet of a Beta Branch Policy is the vast pool of environmental Branch triggers. The remaining facets are relatively simple. The properties explored below are generalizations and are not guaranteed to apply to every Beta Vice.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Environmental Branch Triggers(s)</strong><br/>Due to their gradual advent, this pool of triggers is often vast and seemingly disconnected. While other classifications favor specific areas of triggers, such as smells or sounds, Beta Vices tend to exhibit a holistic approach, storing anything from minute details to common, vague characteristics broadly applicable to a wide variety of situations that make understanding these triggers difficult and frustrating. In their early stages, Beta Vices intentionally select varying sets of triggers to prevent Hosts from detecting patterns and avoiding Branches.</li>
                        <li><strong>Branch Arena Blueprint</strong><br/>While gradual advents tend to result in complex Branch Arenas, Beta Vices are often more concerned with establishing triggers from advent, and their Branch Arenas tend to lose complexity as a result. These blueprints are still more complex than those of Alpha Vices and typically feature multiple stages. Examining these stages can provide valuable insight into determining the varying sources of the wide variety of Branch triggers.</li>
                        <li><strong>Exhibition Presentation</strong></br>Beta exhibitions are not terribly complex and are often influenced by their Branch Arena; that is to say, if an arena is tall, the exhibition may have wings or a way to scale the walls. Beta exhibitions, like all other classifications, grow in complexity over time, often perfecting these methods of navigating their respective arenas.</li>
                        <li><strong>Exhibition Attack Strategy</strong></br>Beta exhibitions are hasty, prioritizing evasion and camouflage tactics. They intend to dodge attacks and dissuade combat, opting instead to make the Host or Adjuncts “hunt” for them among the arena. This allows the Vice ample time to perform germination. Though, once the exhibition is found or cornered, it is not terribly sophisticated in its attack strategy and can be easily addressed.</li>
                        <li><strong>Core Priorities</strong><br/>Beta cores prioritize germination, often resulting in chronic blights. They intend to fully establish their network in adolescence before pursuing augmentation once they reach maturity, paving the way for an efficient dispersion once pursued.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h2>Proposed Care Team</h2>
                    <p>While all Vices are different, the proposed care team below can give a general idea of the skills and equipment needed to properly address a Beta Vice.</p>
                    <dl class="desc-list">
                        <dt><a href="../../about/our-team/primary-care.html#vms">Vice Management Specialist</a></dt>
                        <dd>These agents will construct a holistic, comprehensive understanding of the Vice and facilitate care accordingly. Vice Management Specialists are experts on your specific Vice’s behavior, meaning they can enlist the help of other agents where extra support may be needed.</dd>
                        <dt><a href="../../about/our-team/primary-care.html#vmc">Vice Management Coordinator</a></dt>
                        <dd>These agents are often enlisted to help Vice Management Specialists keep track of Vice details and provide extra firepower in the Branch Arena, if necessary.</dd>
                        <dt><a href="../../about/our-team/primary-care.html#solutions-architect">Solutions Architect</a></dt>
                        <dd>While Solutions Architects are typically enlisted as pseudo Adjuncts to provide support in the Branch Arena, these agents can also offer their problem-solving skills in determining a Beta Vice’s broad pool of triggers in its tricky early stages.</dd>

                        <dd>These agents are master wielders of their patch and can bring much-needed firepower to addressing a Beta Vice in an efficient and timely manner.</dd>
                        <dt><a href="../../about/our-team/primary-care.html#blight-specialist">Blight Specialist</a></dt>
                        <dd>Due to their extensive networks, Beta Vices often trigger chronic blights, which can be addressed and relieved by a resident Blight Specialist, either by prescribing Suppressants or administering AV Shots.</dd>
