                        <p>Beta Vices are often viewed as the more intelligent, “evolved” version of Alpha Vices. Due to having a gradual advent, more aggressive blights, and a higher chance of rogue Branches, these Vices have a higher threat level than Alpha Vices. A Vice that shares all the qualities of an Alpha Vice but has a gradual advent is in all likelihood a Beta Vice and will show its true colors as it matures.</p>

                    <p>Beta Vices were the first classification to deviate from Alpha Vices, due in large part to the introduction of gradual advents. The complexity of gradual advents led to Vices with more aggressive blights and a higher propensity for what many mistake as “rogue” Branches. These Branches are not so much “rogue” as they are simply Branches pulling from a broad collection of environmental triggers established during the Vice’s gradual advent.</p>
                    <p>Beta Vices prioritize germination, resulting in more Branches throughout their life cycles. Because their broad pool of triggers is difficult to prepare for in early stages, Beta Vices result in berserk Hosts more often than Alpha Vices. More mature Beta Vices use their complex, well-established network to pave the way for extremely thorough augmentation prior to dispersion.</p>
                    <p>While these Vices have a higher threat level than Alpha Vices, they are no more intelligent or crafty in the creation of their Branch Policy. The key to addressing Beta Vices lies in unraveling its complex environmental Branch triggers, which can then be bested by maintaining composure and applying brute force. Beta Vices rely on catching Hosts off guard rather than prioritizing complex arenas and exhibitions.</p>

                        <h3>Larval</h3>
                    </div>
                    <p>Beta Vices can be somewhat active in their larval stage, but are generally considered tame compared to Vices of the same threat level. Due to their gradual advent, the Branch Policy of a Beta Vice is often difficult to pin down during the larval stage, leading to a broad, seemingly disconnected collection of environmental Branch triggers.</p>
                    <p>In anticipation of their germination as they mature, larval Beta Vices generally feed more than Alpha Vices and are more skilled at ensnaring passing hormones due to biological deviations. While Alpha Vices tend to have a smooth core, the epithelium around larval Beta cores are wispy, almost hairy, displaying what are essentially rudimentary network tracks. This causes them to appear somewhat fuzzy on a VGMS. This fuzziness results in quick classification times, which are often applied shortly after a positive VGDS.</p>
                    <p>Due to their “hairy” epithelium, Betas are more discerning in their retreat, using these fuzzy proto-tracks as a gauge to make more informed decisions. Even if a larval Beta core is not hit directly, but its epithelium senses and processes the attack as something life-threatening, it will terminate the Branch prematurely.</p>
                    <h4>Rescission Guidance</h4>
                    <p>Rescission at this stage is encouraged, as allowing the Vice to mature will only give it the opportunity to perfect its Brain Domain attack strategy. Larval Beta cores are still quite reactive, so accuracy, efficiency and power are all imperative when wielding a patch. After classification, establishing a CVRS care team is imperative to success. The varied arsenal of patches available from CVRS agents can aid in addressing a larval Beta Vice quickly and efficiently.</p>

                        <span class="superhead">Stage 2</span>
                        <h3>Adolescent</h3>
                    </div>
                    <p>While most adolescent Vices are generally impulsive and rambunctious, adolescent Beta Vices tend to be even more so, eager to pursue a more complex network or capitalize on a recently-expanded network. Due to its gradual advent, the environmental Branch triggers can be relatively difficult to pin down. Beta Vices take advantage of this ambiguity by initiating Branches often, using different combinations of Branch triggers so as to avoid the Host accurately predicting Branches. Additionally, adolescent Beta Vices use the time the Host spends on orienting themself at the beginning of the Branch to establish and then greatly expand their network.</p>
                    <p>Because of these established networks, many Hosts exhibit severe acute blights during Branches and chronic drape blights between Branches. A Vice Management Specialist is likely to prescribe daily Suppressants to provide relief, while performing rigorous VGMS between Branches to monitor Vice behavior.</p>
                    <p>Relying on the more complex Branch Domains that result from a gradual advent, adolescent Beta exhibitions are often a product of their environment, having characteristics that enable them to efficiently interact with the domain. As they mature, they solidify this relationship with their domain.</p>
                    <p>Adolescent Beta cores tend to shed the fuzzy epithelium found in the larval stage in favor of its more advanced and efficient network. As the network expands, the core is likely to expand with it, often leading to larger, more fragile cores susceptible to attacks. Regular AVShots can be used to both tame excessive germination and damage the core, though they do risk instigating rogue Branches.</p>
                    <h4>Rescission Guidance</h4>
                    <p>Rescinding adolescent Beta Vices is generally straightforward, especially when the Branch is initiated on the Host’s time as a result of instigation, rather than trying to orient oneself in an unexpected Branch where the Vice has the upper hand. Because these Vices have performed core augmentation as a sort of “afterthought” of germination, adolescent Beta cores are generally quite fragile and are more susceptible to lethal blows due to their broader surface area. Because of this, Beta Vices require a less complex care team in adolescence, and most patches established by the Host are well-suited for its exhibition.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="timeline__stop">
                    <div class="heading-group">
                        <span class="superhead">Stage 3</span>
                        <h3>Mature</h3>
                    </div>
                    <p>Because Beta Vices prioritize germination so heavily during adolescence, they begin to exhibit a dangerous intentionality in maturity. Augmentation is less of an afterthought and pursued thoughtfully, resulting in denser, less fragile cores. Because of their established networks, mature Beta Vices are likely to create rumina and better survey the environment with stolons to initiate more intentional Branches and take advantage of high-stress situations to catch the Host off guard with lethal rogue Branches.</p>
                    <p>By this time, a Host is likely to have outlined the broad array of environmental Branch triggers, but the Vice has often begun prioritizing other facets of its Branch Policy, namely perfecting its exhibition and Branch Domain blueprint. Mature Beta exhibitions are extremely in-tune with their Branch Domain and are able to utilize the environment to bolster their attack, defense, and evasion strategies equally. Even if a Host is able to predict and prepare for a Branch, they often have trouble both defending against and attacking a mature Beta exhibition.</p>
                    <h4>Rescission Guidance</h4>
                    <p>Because their cores are less fragile, mature Beta Vices require a care team similar in composition to its larval stage, with a focus on power. The threat of mature Beta exhibitions does not necessarily lie in their intelligence, but rather in their efficiency and confidence. Though their calculated and methodical attacks can be intimidating in the Branch Domain, their attack strategies are not complex and can generally be bested with brute force, typically with the help of a Branch Administrator.</p>

                    <h2>Branch Policy Properties</h2>
                    <p>The most complex facet of a Beta Branch Policy is the vast pool of environmental Branch triggers, while the remaining facets are relatively simple. The properties explored below are generalizations and are not guaranteed to apply to every Beta Vice.</p>
                    <dl class="desc-list">
                        <dt>Environmental Branch Triggers(s)</dt>
                        <dd>Due to their gradual advent, this pool of triggers is often vast and seemingly disconnected. While other classifications favor specific areas of triggers, such as smells or sounds, Beta Vices tend to exhibit a holistic approach, storing anything from minute details to common, vague characteristics broadly applicable to a wide variety of situations that make understanding these triggers difficult and frustrating. In their early stages, Beta Vices intentionally select varying sets of triggers to prevent Hosts from detecting patterns and avoiding Branches.</dd>
                        <dt>Branch Domain Blueprint</dt>
                        <dd>While gradual advents tend to result in complex Branch Domains, Beta Vices are often more concerned with establishing triggers from advent, and their Branch Domains tend to lose complexity as a result. These blueprints are still more complex than those of Alpha Vices and typically feature multiple stages. Examining these stages can provide valuable insight into determining the varying sources of the wide variety of Branch triggers.</dd>
                        <dt>Exhibition Presentation</dt>
                        <dd>Beta exhibitions are not terribly complex and are often influenced by their Branch Domain; that is to say, if an arena is tall, the exhibition may have wings or a way to scale the walls. Beta exhibitions, like all other classifications, grow in complexity over time, often perfecting these methods of navigating their respective arenas. By maturity, Beta exhibitions are considered “one” with their Branch Domain and can prove to be extremely difficult to take down.</dd>
                        <dt>Exhibition Attack Strategy</dt>
                        <dd>Beta exhibitions have a balanced approach in the Branch Domain, often swapping between attack, defense, and evasion. Unlike the more intelligent Xi classification, this swapping is less a result of observation and documentation, and more guided by impulse and instinct. For this reason, Betas can often be easily outsmarted and overpowered by the appropriate team.</dd>
                        <dt>Core Priorities</dt>
                        <dd>Beta cores prioritize germination, often resulting in chronic blights. They intend to fully establish their network in adolescence before pursuing augmentation, paving the way for an efficient dispersion once pursued.</dd>
