                        <p>Lambda Vices are a relatively rare classification of Vice that deviates from all expected behavioral norms. Lambda Vices always have a sudden advent, but the Branch initiated at advent is leaps and bounds more complex than any other classification’s. Hosts with a Lambda Vice should be addressed by a Branch Administrator. If the Branch is addressed, future Branches will drastically decrease in severity.</p>

                    <p>Most Branches that result from a sudden advent are weak and can be addressed alone, even without a patch; Branch Domains tend to be simple, and exhibitions are inexperienced and brittle. An initial Lambda Branch, however, has an uncharacteristically complex Branch Domain and a large, powerful exhibition that can easily overwhelm the new Host. These Branches essentially cannot be addressed without the proper resources and support from a team of CVRS agents.</p>
                    <p>That being said, not all hope is lost. Learning to recognize the warning signs of an impending Lambda advent can be the difference between life and death, for both you and for others. Target Hunters are often scanning public spaces for these exact behaviors and symptoms.</p>
                    <p>Hosts typically display a distinctive set of behaviors in the time leading up to the Branch. Hosts claim they become unreasonably aggressive and agitated, yelling loudly and getting into arguments or even committing acts of physical violence. They are also often seen pacing and engaging in anxious subconscious behaviors such as skin picking or chewing their nails. Physiological symptoms can be mild--such as goosebumps and blown pupils--or extreme, threatening the Host’s wellbeing with elevated heart rates and anaphylaxis. Hosts claim to feel disconnected from their bodies and unable to control their behaviors.</p>
                    <p>These behaviors and symptoms often prove difficult to explicitly classify as Vice-related, as many can be experienced outside of a Vice-induced situation. Fortunately, a single, distinct symptom occurs in all Lambda Hosts that can signal a Lambda advent is imminent. Roughly half an hour before advent, Hosts can be seen emitting expulsion blights, such as smoke or electricity. Experts are still struggling to fully understand this phenomenon and how it occurs. Because blights are products of a Vice’s core or network, a Host having this symptom is simply unheard of. The current theory is that advent occurs, and the resulting Branch is a delayed reaction. Because expulsion blights emanate from the core, an established network is not needed.</p>
                    <p>If the initial Lambda Branch is committed, all subsequent Branches will become significantly easier, devolving drastically between initiations. Due to the sheer amount of energy needed to initiate the advent Branch, Lambdas do not have the opportunity to establish proper energy processing or storage systems, resulting in faulty biology that “leaks” its resources. Over time, Branches become quite simple, mimicking those of larval Alpha Vices. Most Lambda Vices do not make it to maturity.</p>

                        <h3>Larval</h3>
                    </div>
                    <p>The most tumultuous stage of Lambda Vices, larvae are unnaturally aggressive, going against all biological norms. Experts are still unsure in what conditions result in a Lambda Vice. Their intimidating advent Branch alone is what elevates these Vices to a high threat level.</p>
                    <p>Even though larval Lambdas begin to devolve after their initial advent Branch, larval Branches should not be underestimated. Branch activity tends to be quite high in the larval stage, almost as if they know they are on borrowed time. Periods between Branches are generally quite short, and the first few consecutive Branches after advent can still pack quite the punch.</p>
                    <p>Like the advent Branch, consecutive Branches are often given away by excessive expulsion blight activity in the moments leading up to initiation. Call your Vice Management Specialist or Public Deployment team at the first sign of elevated blight activity. Expulsion blights should be otherwise calm or nonexistent between Branches.</p>
                    <h4>Rescission Guidance</h4>
                    <p>The same strategy used in addressing a Lambda’s advent Branch can be applied to its consecutive Branches. While exhibitions may not be as intimidating and Branch Domains are less detailed, the same level of caution should still be applied, and any rescission attempts should be made with a Vice Management Specialist and the team they deem necessary for success. Patches are also likely to manifest shortly after advent, before the next Branch.</p>

                    </div>
                    <p>Most adolescent Vices are impulsive and aggressive, but Lambdas tend to lose steam by adolescence, resulting in weak, brittle exhibitions and simple Branch Domains. While not as uncommon as mature Labmbdas, they are relatively rare, as most Hosts with a Lambda Vice have sought treatment via CVRS, and most Vice Management Specialists are able to rescind Lambdas before they reach adolescence.</p>
                    <h4>Rescission Guidance</h4>
                    <p>Though an adolescent Lambda is likely to have devolved enough to no longer be a threat, they should still be approached with caution. The strategies used to address larval Lambda Vices can easily be used for their adolescent Branches, though the same degree of strength is often not required. We still recommend pursuing rescission with a Vice Management Specialist, just in case.</p>

                    </div>
                    <p>Not much is known about mature Lambda Vices, as they rarely reach this life stage. Because of their devolution over time, mature Lambdas essentially have the same threat level as a Phi Vice, making them easy to rescind.</p>

                    <!-- BRANCH POLICY -->
                    <h2>Branch Policy Properties</h2>
                    <p>The Branch Policy of Lambdas, despite their explosive advent, tend to be quiet simple. In fact, as they mature, they actually tend to simplify, with certain properties essentially devolving between Branches. The properties explored below are generalizations and are not guaranteed to apply to every Lambda Vice.</p>
                    <dl class="desc-list">
                        <dt>Environmental Branch Triggers(s)</dt>
                        <dd>Lambda Branch triggers pull from those at advent, almost exactly. As other properties may seem to devolve, this property stays relatively static. The conditions of advent that are references are typically quite distinct, leaning into more objective categories such as smells, sounds, and tastes.</dd>
                        <dt>Branch Domain Blueprint</dt>
                        <dd>The initial explosive Branch contains a Branch Domain that is not necessarily complex, though it is extremely detailed. Early Lambda Branch Domains are almost exact replicas of the recent conditions found at advent. This can create an extremely disorienting effect during one’s advent Branch where the Host may struggle to distinguish between realms. Though, as the Vice matures, details tend to fade, and the domain simplifies drastically.</dd>
                        <dt>Exhibition Presentation</dt>
                        <dd>Early Lambda exhibitions are large, formidable foes. Lambda exhibitions prioritize attack and typically have features that support those endeavors, such as large fists, sharp claws, or thick tails. Lambda exhibitions are often bipedal humanoids. Their simple designs allow for explicit focus on attack strategy.</dd>
                        <dt>Exhibition Attack Strategy</dt>
                        <dd>Especially in its initial Branch, Lambda exhibitions are honed to attack as hard and as often as possible. Their bipedal nature allows them to efficiently throw devastating punches, often their primary mode of attack. They are generally slow and lack defenses, but due to the Host’s inexperience, they are often not equipped to fight back, let alone defend from its onslaught of attacks. As the Vice matures, however, it seems to run out of steam.</dd>
                        <dt>Core Priorities</dt>
                        <dd>The entirety of a Lambda’s existence is poured into its advent, starting off strong to hit as hard as possible. If a Host has the proper resources to address this initial Branch, the Vice typically does not have the biology established to maintain its hard-hitting Branch Policy, resulting in its devolution over time. Though, if a Host is unable to gather the proper resources prior to advent, dispersion is likely, resulting in this classification’s high threat level.</dd>

                    <h2 class="mt-xl">Proposed Care Team</h2>
                    <p>While all Vices are different, the proposed care team below can give a general idea of the skills and equipment needed to properly address a Lambda Vice.</p>

                        <dd>After the advent Branch has been addressed, these agents will construct a holistic, comprehensive understanding of the Vice and facilitate care accordingly. Vice Management Specialists are experts on your specific Vice’s behavior, meaning they can enlist the help of other agents where extra support may be needed.</dd>

                        <dd>As a Public Deployment agent, Target Hunters are always on the lookout for explicit Lambda advent behaviors in public. If targeted, an agent will either call its Branch Administrator to commit the Branch or suspend the Branch and refer the Host to Urgent Care for Branch Remediation.</dd>
                        <dt><a href="../../about/our-team/public-deployment.html#branch-administrator">Branch Administrator</a></dt>
                        <dd>These agents are master wielders of their patch and can bring much-needed firepower--especially during one’s initial advent Branch--to addressing a Lambda Vice in an efficient and timely manner.</dd>

                        <dd>Often on patrol with Branch Administrators, these agents are typically enlisted to support a a Branch Administrator in the Branch Domain, especially for an initial advent Branch.</dd>
