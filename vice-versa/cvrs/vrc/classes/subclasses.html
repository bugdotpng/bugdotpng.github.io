Subclasses differ from primary classes in that they are unique behaviors or characteristics found throughout all classifications.

                    <p>Subclasses are a fairly new facet of Vice research, primarily contributed to and conducted by <a href="../../about/our-team/observation.html#behavioral-analysts">Behavioral Analysts</a>. Subclasses are denoted with a leading double-hyphen and are always lowercase (e.g. Epsilon--gamma) and do not impact threat levels, though some can be unique to specific threat levels. Subclasses can also be stacked, for example: Epsilon--gamma--sigma.</p>
                    <p>The current subclasses are <a href="#gamma">--gamma</a>, <a href="#omicron">--omicron</a>, <a href="#sigma">--sigma</a>, and <a href="#rho">--rho</a>.</p>
                    <h2 id="gamma">--gamma</h2>
                    <p>This relatively rare subclass is often applied post-dispersion, as Vices with the --gamma subclass seem to exhibit sentience and are, therefore, extremely difficult to rescind without the proper resources. Vices in this subclass have been known to observe and document their Hosts' behaviors to an unnervingly accurate degree, even going so far as being able to read thoughts and communicate with speech in the Branch Domain. Only Vices with a high or critical threat level are capable of having the --gamma subclass.</p>
                    <p>Intelligent Vices are not necessarily granted the --gamma label. For example, Xi Vices are known for being able to observe their Host and make calculated decisions, but there have been no known instances of a Xi--gamma Vice. --gamma Vices display a level of self-awareness not seen in other Vices. What makes these Vices particularly dangerous is that their decisions are often influenced by their emotions, which we as Hosts and Adjuncts are not privy to unless they communicate with us. Even then, many Vices pride themselves on deception, and we have no way of verifying if what they are telling us is true.</p>
                    <p>While intelligence and observational skills can make other Vices difficult to deal with, ultimately with enough resources, we are able to learn why they take certain actions, as it all boils down to instinct and a drive to procreate or survive. When feelings are introduced into the mix, it becomes much more difficult to draw conclusions and make hypotheses about how a Vice can be expected to behave. Emotions often muddy and overcomplicate their Branch Policy. Some Hosts have reported a foreign sense of guilt emanating from their core when they discuss rescission techniques with their Vice Management Administrator, almost as if the Vice is pleading for its life. Some have even expressed affection or attachment with the Host.</p>
                    <p>One may think the ability to communicate with their Vice would swing things in the Host’s favor, but this often introduces another avenue for the Vice to take advantage of its Host. Within the Branch Domain, many --gamma Vices use their speech capabilities to manipulate, confuse, or lie to the Host to gain the upper hand, either in the current Branch or future Branches.</p>
                    <p>Speech seems to manifest in different ways between different --gamma Vices. Those with a high threat level seem to have difficulty forming complete sentences, but their vocabulary is quite expansive. A few Vices with a critical threat level (Omegas, specifically) have been documented as being able to hold full, complex conversations. Maturity tends to affect this ability as well, with most larval Vices struggling to communicate. As the Vice matures and observes its Host for longer, communication seems to come somewhat easier.</p>
                    <p>Branch activity also seems to dictate how a Vice can communicate, as these speech capabilities have only been documented in the Branch Domain during production. Outside of an active Branch, this speech manifests in what many claim is a way that is similar to invasive thoughts. They’re not necessarily complete sentences, but they do convey feelings and ideas in a relatively abstract way, directed straight to the Host’s brain.</p>
                    <p>--gamma Vices are quite difficult to handle, as it almost feels impossible to escape their watchful, calculating eye. Many Hosts report the constant, unnerving feeling of being watched, and --gamma Vices always seem prepared for any new strategies the Host discussed with their Vice Management Administrator. Catching a --gamma Vice by surprise is near impossible, and it’s not fully understood what all these Vices are able to observe.</p>
                    <h2 id="omicron">--omicron</h2>
                    <p>--omicron Vices are capable of camouflaging their network. These Vices have evolved to emit a dense, neutralizing particle that coats both their core and the tracks of their network and prevents them from being seen, even with Parsing Goggles. This technique is implemented as a way to lure Hosts into a false sense of security by keeping their network activity hidden. In some instances, this ability has also prevented accurate classification.</p>
                    <p>It is believed that this subclass of Vices evolved specifically to camouflage the stolon and prevent the detection of an established rumen. Non--omicron rumen are easily detected using Parsing Goggles to track the path of the stolon from the Host to the rumen. Without the ability to see the network, this path is not visible.</p>
                    <p>--omicron Vices tend to “turn off” this camouflaging mechanism prior to Branch initiation. This allows those outside of the Branch to observe and document the network. This mechanism will resume after the Branch has been addressed.</p>
                    <p>Our Manufacturing team is currently working on a new type of lens for Parsing Goggles to address this issue. While this technique can throw less experienced Hosts for a loop, it should be known that the core should always be visible with Parsing Goggles and a VGMS, and once the network becomes established in adolescence, though it will be faint, it will always be visible through those channels as well. A complete inability to see ones core is a dead giveaway that the Vice has --omicron capabilities.</p>
                    <h2 id="sigma">--sigma</h2>
                    <p>--sigma Vices have wider diet preferences, most commonly observed in, but not unique to, Zeta Vices. Where other Vices feed on hormones, --sigma Vices are much more permissive and feed on other bodily substances such as plasma or synovial fluid in addition to hormones. --sigma Vices typically have a gradual advent, are more likely to reach maturity, and are known for more complex Branch Policies.</p>
                    <p>A --sigma palate is much less particular, and they can shift their primary energy source depending on resource availability. They are much more adaptable and resilient in times of scarcity, where other Vices may need to sacrifice growth. --sigma cores are often larger than others, though they do tend to be less structurally sound and are more susceptible to damage from AV or attacks in the Branch Domain. Despite their permissive palate, Vices biologically benefit best from the consumption of hormones, so if a --sigma Vice doesn’t keep a varied diet that also includes hormones, its form can be compromised.</p>
                    <p>Due to the elevated feeding habits of most larval Vices, many with a --sigma subclass are actually initially discovered by health professionals outside of CVRS. Because their feeding is not confined to hormones, --sigma Vices often result in adverse medical effects and can be initially detected using medical imaging or blood tests.</p>
                    <h2 id="rho">--rho</h2>
                    <p>While most Vices have a single, stationary core, --rho Vices have multiple, smaller cores throughout the Host’s body connected by an extremely dense network that often presents as stiff joints. This subclass typically accompanies Vices of a higher threat level and are often stacked with the --gamma subclass. Vices with established networks often receive this subclass, such as Zeta and Epsilon Vices.</p>
                    <p>--rho Vices start out with a single core that houses and processes information. As they mature, they create more cores in a process not dissimilar to advent, wherein the VG coursing throughout the body colonizes a benign mass. Cores created post-advent act like rumina until the main core is threatened, either by a patch in the Branch Domain or by manual intervention with an AV Shot. Even after sustaining damage, the core is able to send the bulk of its information--including its Branch Policy and other data--to a different core using the network. This process is near-instantaneous, taking no more than a few seconds to send the information from head to toe. All Vice cores will need to be destroyed in order for the Vice to be properly rescinded.</p>
