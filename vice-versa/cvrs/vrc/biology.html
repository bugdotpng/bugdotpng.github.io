                    <h2 id="advent">Advent</h2>
                    <p>Vices are formed when a large concentration of vitiumglomerora (VG) in a Host’s body colonizes a benign mass or embeds itself in the soft tissue of non-essential organs. Due to the recent rise in Vice infections, we come into contact with VG on the daily. Stagnant clouds of VG are unavoidable in public areas with poor airflow, but even outdoor areas have a low, steady level of VG. While wearing a mask can prevent them from being inhaled, VG are still able to enter our body through other orifices, microscopic tears in the skin, and even our pores.</p>
                    <p>Our body is often able to destroy these spores much like it would defend against bacteria or a virus by deploying antibodies or raising the body’s temperature. This behavior is typically triggered by relatively sizable concentrations of VG being introduced to the body, but small amounts of VG gradually being contracted over time often remain undetected and can result in a conglomeration of VG.</p>
                    <p>Outside of the body, VG are so light that they are able to hang in the air, but once they are in the bloodstream, our plasma activates a “magnetic” property that allows VG to “find” its peers and clump together. While these clumps are generally benign on their own, the exposure to hormones of any kind is what ultimately prompts the mass to take root and begin forming a thick, tacky epithelium. At this time, the mass is roughly 5-6mm.</p>
                    <p>The advent of a Vice occurs in one of two ways: sudden or gradual. Sudden advents tend to be more common in Vices with a lower threat level, while gradual advents often result in Vices with a higher threat level, though this is not concrete.</p>
                    <h3>Sudden Advent</h3>
                    <p>A sudden advent is triggered by an abrupt increase in hormone levels, typically due to a stressful or traumatic event. This dramatic influx of hormones fuels the expedited creation of VG. The excessive spawning of these VG causes them to leak from the mass and flood the Host’s system, prompting the first Branch. This Branch is often simple and straightforward, with a fragile exhibition and simple Branch Arena. Most Vices prematurely terminate the Branch and retreat due to their lack of established energy reserves, resulting in an uncharacteristically short Branch.</p>
                    <p>The properties observed during all phases of this initial Branch give valuable insight into preparing for future Branches&mdash;known collectively as the Branch Policy&mdash;as these properties tend to remain the same over time for the majority of classifications. Sudden advents are common and provide relatively straightforward information that often helps in addressing future Branches.</p>
                    <h3>Gradual Advent</h3>
                    <p>Gradual advents occur when the mass is exposed to a steady increase in hormones over a period of time, rather than being tied to a single event. A Vice with a gradual advent prioritizes thickening its epithelium, which later becomes the foundation for its core, as opposed to producing large quantities of VG in its early stages.</p>
                    <p>Because there is no initial Branch tied to a specific event, Vices with a gradual advent tend to have more complex Branch Policies, influenced by the variety of events experienced as the Vice is forming. This often leads to larger exhibitions, more complex Branch Arenas, and vague or inconsistent triggers.</p>
                    <p>Vices with a gradual advent are typically indicated by increased and uncharacteristic fatigue. The first Branch initiated by the Vice often takes the Host by surprise, and due to the early emphasis on epithelium enhancement, these Branches are often more difficult to address. These Vices are still immature, however, and will eventually run out of steam and terminate the Branch, but due to the extended Branch time, the Vice core is often allowed to expand more than that of a Vice with a sudden advent. Because of this early advantage, gradual advents typically produce Vices with higher threat levels.</p>

                    </div>
                    <p>After advent, Vices enter the larval stage. Most Vices do not reach maturity, as rescission is often performed before a Vice can fully mature. Maturity does not always look the same or warrant the same degree of caution between classifications. For example, an adolescent Epsilon Vice typically poses a greater threat than a mature Alpha Vice, and two larval Vices from different classifications can have completely different behavior.</p>
                    <p>Generally speaking, however, mature Vices tend to be more calculated and dangerous than larvae and adolescents. Vices can make attempts to and pursue dispersion at any stage, but it is most commonly executed to completion by mature Vices, while adolescent Vices tend to make the most attempts.</p>

                        <h3>Larval</h3>
                    </div>
                    <p>These young Vices spend the majority of their time storing energy and learning their environment. Branches at this stage are unlikely, as energy is typically used for establishing its core and producing VG; energy can also be stored during times of excess as a reserve for periods of scarcity. Larval Vices have a tendency to prematurely terminate Branches before the core sustains any damage, as Branches can often be too much of an energy sink for the core to function properly. This is most commonly observed in the initial Branch that occurs from a sudden advent.</p>
                    <p>Vices spend anywhere from 6 months to a year in the larval stage, and can be expected to initiate a Branch once or twice. Larval cores are relatively small, typically between 10 and 20mm, though they tend to be extremely dense and compact, likely as a defense mechanism. Larval Vices do not have a network and typically present as a circular or oblong, solid white mass on a VGMS.</p>
                    <p>In this stage, many Hosts report uncharacteristic fatigue, brain fog, and elevated hormone production. While Vices do not directly stimulate hormone production, our bodies often begin overcompensating for the percentage ensnared by the core. Rather than immediately using these resources to grow, Vices avoid detection by the Host’s immune system by supplementing their feeding gradually over time. Larval Vices with a gradual advent often avoid detection until adolescence.</p>
                    <p>Zeta Vices, particularly, are characterized by excessive feeding, leading to almost non-functioning levels lethargy and extremely volatile hormone levels. Experts posit that Zeta Vices have a “magnetic” epithelium around their core that actually attracts stray hormones rather than feeding passively. This excessive feeding is not acute and can last anywhere from a month to half a year, which often drives Hosts to pursue rescission.</p>
                    <p>Rescission at any stage poses risks, even at the larval stage. The Branch Policy of a larval Vice has not been determined and cannot be prepared for thoroughly, though the probability of an advanced exhibition and complex Branches are unlikely.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="timeline__stop">
                    <div class="heading-group">
                        <span class="superhead">Stage 2</span>
                        <h3>Adolescent</h3>
                    </div>
                    <p>After a Vice has established its core and familiarized itself with its environment, it will move into the adolescent stage. Using the resources hoarded in the larval stage, Vices will being initiating Branches in an attempt to expand its network (germination) and grow its core (augmentation).</p>
                    <p>Adolescent Vices are visually distinct from larval vices due to the beginnings of a network, which can be seen using a VGMS, though they tend to be faint. During Branches, Vices begin stretching their core, protected by their thickened epithelium as they unfurl from their previously compact state. During this stage, a Vice core can range anywhere from 15mm to 50mm, depending on varying factors such as classification, access to resources, and Branch impulsivity.</p>
                    <p>As the network becomes established, individual tracks are assigned specific duties, with thinner tracks monitoring environmental changes and thicker tracks transporting hormones for feeding. Some tracks are even embedded into organs like lymph nodes, pituitary glands, and even parts of the brain, or are extended outside the body--known as a stolon--to monitor a wealth of environmental properties, like temperature, sound, or even relative humidity.</p>
                    <p>Now that the Vice is familiar with the Host’s hormone fluctuations, patterns will begin to emerge in Branch initiation, often tying in to stressful events with properties that mirror those found at advent. The Vice’s newly established network plays an essential role in detecting changes in its environment that instruct the Vice when to best and most effectively initiate Branches.</p>
                    <p>Each Branch requires massive amounts of energy to fuel germination, augmentation, and the creation of the Branch Arena, so repeated Branches in quick succession are unlikely. Adolescent Vices are learning how to balance between feeding, growth, and initiating Branches, and they begin observing and documenting their Host’s behavior using their newly established network.</p>
                    <p>Vices typically spend a minimum of two years in the adolescent stage. Some classifications are simply unable to progress to maturity due to their lack of intelligence or ability to plan, but they should not be underestimated. Adolescent Vices are impulsive and inexperienced, but they are likely to initiate rogue Branches that deviate from their Branch Policy. Many are able to take their Host by surprise and capitalize on the prolonged Branch time as the Host regains their footing.</p>
                    <p>Generally speaking, a successful rescission is fairly likely in this stage with the right resources thanks to the Vice’s inexperience, but the longer a Vice spends in the adolescent stage, the more experienced and dangerous it becomes. If a Vice is particularly aggressive or deceptive, it is highly encouraged to instigate a Branch and pursue rescission with a support team before it matures further.</p>
                    <p>An estimated 65% of Vices do not reach maturity; roughly 15% of these Vices are simply incapable of doing so due to their unique characteristics, as seen in Phi and Delta Vices. The remaining 40% are rescinded before they are able to reach maturity.</p>

                        <span class="superhead">Stage 3</span>
                        <h3>Mature</h3>
                    </div>
                    <p>Vice maturity is marked by considerable expansion along its network, with cores typically ranging from 40mm to 80mm--though some mature Vices have been documented to be as long as 150mm. Mature Vice networks are much more established, and easily seen with a VGMS or Parsing Goggles. Mature Vices tend to exacerbate blights more than other stages, resulting in more prominent, chronic blights.</p>
                    <p>Mature Vices are also marked by their restraint; that is, demonstrating that they have learned to wait for the opportune time to initiate Branches, rather than initiating Branches whenever the environment appears to be suitable.</p>
                    <p>Mature Vices have mastered the art of feeding and balancing Branches, optimizing their energy consumption. They do not prioritize feeding or growth, but rather they focus on utilizing the information gathered to take advantage of the Host’s vulnerabilities. Quality over quantity is the name of the game with mature Vices. They are much more calculated than adolescent Vices, and while Branches are less common, they’re much more dangerous.</p>
                    <p>Rumina are typically only established by mature Vices, as they require a level of awareness and foresight not typically observed in adolescent Vices. Establishing rumina has become more of a common practice among mature Vices as of late, indicating an increase in overall intelligence. Mature Vices of every classification are capable of establishing a rumen, but it is much more common in those with higher threat levels.</p>
                    <p>Rescission in this stage is not guaranteed and will likely require a team of dedicated Adjuncts, no matter the Vice’s classification. Some Vices--notably Epsilon and Omega Vices--are capable of altering their Branch Policy as a defense mechanism, often making for precarious rescissions. Having an established CVRS care team will greatly improve the chances of a successful rescission.</p>

                    <h2 id="defense">Reactivity and Defense Mechanisms</h2>
                    <p>Vice cores must have a relatively steady flow of hormones and a stable environmental temperature of anywhere between 98 and 100 degrees fahrenheit. Because this is not always guaranteed, larval Vices focus on hoarding hormones for times of scarcity and uncertainty. Many young Vices also redirect their energy reserves to thicken their epithelium--a thick, blubbery outer layer that acts as insulation for the core in harsh environments. This layer not only helps the Vice regulate temperature, but it can also shield against attacks, such as AV, antibiotics, or white blood cells. This layer is not impenetrable, however, and needs to be repaired often.</p>
                    <p>Once a Vice matures to the adolescent stage, it begins establishing tracks, known collectively as the network. Tracks are not literal extensions of the core, rather, these tendril-like appendages are dense collections of vitiumnexi (VN), unique cells that sense changes in the environment and send rudimentary information back to the core for processing.</p>
                    <p>More established tracks are also able to ensnare passing hormones, which are absorbed into the porous track and sent back to the core for processing. A network is essentially how a Vice is able to "see" their environment and learn their Host’s behaviors in order to brace for any impending threats or act on an opportunity to initiate a Branch. Some Vices even create external tracks--known as stolons--to monitor the properties of the environment outside of the Host, such as temperature, humidity, and even smells and sounds.</p>
                    <p>The exact details of what a Vice considers threatening varies between classifications and even individual Vices. Though, generally speaking, Vices consider drastic changes in the environment as a threat, such as a sharp increase in body temperature, a sudden drop in hormone production, or an unexpected wave of AV (either from a Suppressant dose or AV Shot). Vices with extremely high intelligence levels have displayed a rudimentary understanding of speech. While it has proven difficult to find real-world examples, experts believe Vices are able to recognize these words using their tracks to monitor sound waves, even going so far as to discern the differences in tone between the same word in different contexts.</p>
                    <p>While Vices tend to follow patterns when initiating Branches--these patterns being part of the Branch Policy--in rare instances, they can deviate from their expected behavior and initiate Branches in reaction to a perceived threat, known as a rogue Branch. Rogue Branches are often used to distract a Host and catch them off guard if a Vice feels that it is losing a clear view of the Host's status, often the result of unexpected biofeedback, a sudden drop in hormones, or even an influx of AV from an AVShot. Learn more about rogue Branches in Fringe Branch Events.</p>
                    <h3>Fusion</h3>
                    <p>If a Vice core is threatened outside of the Branch Arena, particularly by manual intervention, the core is likely to fuse with the Host’s body, solidifying its form to withstand external stressors. Fused cores are temporarily unable to continue growing, though after the threat has passed, their rigid structure begins to soften. Many Vices will also choose to fuse specific parts of the core, in what many see as a warning, wherein the Vice will fully perform fusion if the stressors persist.</p>
                    <p>The act of fusion, especially when performed on or near vital organs, can be lethal, as the fused viscera loses its anatomical function, essentially becoming dead tissue, even after the Vice has softened. While the fused core itself does not spread, the damage can leech out into and kill surrounding tissue, often resulting in the need for amputations or organ transplants. Fusion can also damage the Vice core if sustained for too long, making it more susceptible to attacks from AV and patches.</p>
                    <p>A fused core, even partially fused cores, cannot initiate dispersion, which requires the Vice core to stretch itself throughout the Host’s body. For this reason, fusion is only executed when the Vice is under extreme duress as a last-ditch effort to avoid rescission. Vice cores only initiate fusion when they are externally threatened, and standard Branch events are not at risk of triggering fusion. However, suspension can run the risk of prompting fusion, particularly when piercing or slashing patches are used. The risks of suspension are further outlined in Branch Options.</p>
                    <h2 id="energy">Feeding and Energy Processing</h2>
                    <p>Vices primarily feed off of hormones excreted by the Host and tend to prefer those present in high amounts during advent. Vices use these hormones for a wide variety of processes, most commonly contributing to the growth of its core during the larval stage. As the core matures, it begins redirecting its energy reserves toward expanding its network and establishing its Branch Policy.</p>
                    <p>Vices use their network to gather hormones throughout the body and send them back to the core. As larvae, cores are passive feeders that consume hormones that happen to pass by, but as it grows, it begins to send out these tracks to seek out hormones, sometimes even going so far as to embed these tracks in the glands or organs secreting the hormones.</p>
                    <p>The --sigma subclass is capable of feeding on any and all hormones, even extending its palate to other bodily secretions, such as plasma and interstitial fluid. Because of this, these Vices tend to grow exponentially in their larval stage and can quickly grow out of control. Learn more in Vice Classifications.</p>
                    <h3>Establishing the Network</h3>
                    <p>Once a Vice reaches adolescence, it will begin to establish its network, a mycelium-like collection of tracks that branch throughout the Host’s body, originating from the Vice core. These tracks are densely-packed vitiumnexa (VN) surrounding a thin stream of VG. New tracks are extremely fluid and easily damaged but become thicker as the network becomes more established. While the primary purpose of tracks is to monitor surroundings and send nutrients back to the core, it is also the nutrient-rich path that the core expands along during a Branch. Tracks typically follow blood vessels and are able to phase through the endothelium to ensnare passing hormones.</p>
                    <p>As the network grows and new tracks branch off of older ones, these junctions begin to form a thick, calloused outer skin that shields the VN and VG. Though not impenetrable, it takes much higher concentrations of AV to damage these junctions, and as a result, Vices tend to hoard VG and hormones as a sort of small-scale rumen. These are most commonly found adhering to ligaments and surrounding joints. Because of this, established networks can present as joint pain and bodily fatigue, even going so far as to restrict range of motion in extreme cases. There is one documented case of a Host being physically restrained by their Vice’s network.</p>
                    <p>While the network is predominantly internal, in the case of mature Vices, it can extend beyond the Host’s body--this lone track called a stolon--to create a rumen as an external energy reserve.</p>
                    <h3 class="has-label">Establishing Rumina <span class="label">New</span></h3>
                    <p>While Vices are capable of storing small amounts of excess energy in the core, it is typically a limited amount and best suited for initiating rogue Branches. The circumstances that result in a rumen are simultaneously calculated and hinge on luck; for this reason, rumina tend to be relatively rare. Though, as Vice intelligence continues to trend upward, rumina are becoming more common.</p>
                    <p>When establishing their network as an adolescent, Vices with a higher threat level often have a handful of tracks outside of the Host’s body--called stolons--that can extend up to a quarter mile. Stolons spend their time scouting for a suitable organic mass to infect and establish a rumen, an external energy reserve. Rumina are most commonly established by mature Vices.</p>
                    <p>Vices embed these stolons in energy-rich organic matter, most commonly in the form of freshly deceased vermin. The core sends a small, but steady stream of VG through the stolon to colonize the mass and act as a beacon if the connection is lost. Stolons, during this time, remain flexible and do not funnel out too many resources, as the Host is likely to stray outside of the stolon’s reach, causing it to detach. If the Host returns to the designated radius of where the beacon was set, the Vice will attempt to reattach.</p>
                    <p>If a Host remains within the radius for roughly two weeks--though, this time frame is flexible between classifications--the Vice will begin funneling excessive amounts of VG to colonize the mass and begin altering its form to mimic that of the core itself and become a rumen. Because the tissue is not alive, a new Vice is not created; rather, a non-sentient “copy” of the Vice is established. All auxiliary stolons are re-routed to the rumen to reinforce the attached stolon, creating a singular track that is much more rigid and less likely to break. In extreme cases and in instances of higher traffic, this dense stolon can be seen with Parsing Goggles or even with the naked eye. Note that some Vices are able to camouflage their network, including their stolon, known as --omicron Vices.</p>
                    <p>Over time, and as more resources are deposited, the rumen begins to resemble its core, becoming a pile of dark, pulsing flesh that emanates the smells present at advent. Long-standing rumina have been known to develop simple eye-like growths that help monitor the goings-on around them. While these growths do not literally “see” they do help monitor environmental fluctuations and can sense movement or changes in light and temperature. Bone, teeth, and nails from the original carcass are likely to shift within the rumen as it grows and are sometimes visible in its thick outer skin. In extremely established rumina, these organs can sometimes begin to resemble those of the Host.</p>
                    <p>Rumina are not ambulatory, though larger masses tend to pulsate as they internally redirect their energy reserves. Some have also been known to stretch or contract in response to stimuli. They are not sentient like the core, and information is not stored in rumina.</p>
                    <p>A rumen is created as an external energy reserve that can be used to supplement feeding, but they are most commonly used to fuel explosive core growth during an advantageous Branch. When the Vice initiates a Branch near an established rumen, the Vice core will “suck” the contents of the rumen into the Host’s compromised body using the stolon. Because the makeup of the rumen mimics that of the core--an extremely squishy form that can squeeze into microscopic spaces--the viscera is most commonly fazed through pores in the Host’s skin near the Vice core, though it can sometimes enter the Host’s system through other orifices, such as the mouth, nose, or ears if that is the most direct route. This transportation can be interrupted by those outside of the Branch by summoning a patch to destroy the remaining rumen or sever the stolon.</p>
                    <p>Most Vices that do deign to establish a rumen do so multiple times throughout their life cycle, with more mature Vices being able to manage multiple rumen at once. All rumina must maintain connection to the core through its stolon, and any disruptions in connection can trigger the rumen to begin disintegrating. While this stolon is not rigid in a literal sense, the further a Host strays from an established rumen, the more strain the stolon puts on a Vice’s network, and by extension, the Host’s body. This is often observed in complaints of exhaustion, inexplicable body aches, and lack of motivation. If the Host strays too far from the rumen, the stolon will detach, rendering the rumen temporarily unusable. If the Host returns to frequenting the area where the rumen was established—and not too much of it has disintegrated—the Vice can reattach the rumen to its core using its stolon.</p>
                    <p>When a rumen detaches from its core or if a rumen is destroyed, a burst of VG is released, the frayed stolon and disintegrating rumen spewing VG into the environment. Because there is no longer a drain on their system, Hosts often feel a sudden, inexplicable increase in energy. The increased level of VG in the surrounding environment tends to agitate or excite Vices nearby, often spawning rogue Branches. This process floods the surrounding environment with VG and aids in the reproduction of Vices.</p>
                    <h2 id="reproduction">Vice Reproduction</h2>
                    <p>Vices use vitiumglomerorum (VG) to reproduce. Due to the recent rise in Vice infections, these microscopic spores are found in detectable amounts throughout our world and can even be seen with the naked eye in high concentrations. VG most commonly enter our body through orifices and microscopic tears in the skin, but are small enough to enter through our pores as well. Over time, large concentrations of VG in the body can drastically alter the genetic makeup of soft tissue and benign masses to result in the birth of a Vice.</p>
                    <p>Once the core has been established, it can work on producing VG to be distributed in various ways, most commonly seen in the act of dispersion, though the detachment of rumen can also aid in reproduction.</p>

                        <p>The passages below contain information that may be uncomfortable for some readers. The act of dispersion entails the mutilation of the human body, which is outlined in detail below. Proceed with caution or <a href="#rumen-detachment">skip to the next section</a>.</p>
                    </div>
                    <h3>Dispersion</h3>
                    <p>Dispersion is a process expressly reserved for reproduction and therefore has the highest rate of success. Dispersion is the result of an unaddressed Branch—one that is not suspended, committed or rescinded. This means that the Branch keeps the Host and any Adjuncts trapped in the Branch Arena while the Vice continues germination and augmentation. Some Adjuncts are capable of exiting the Branch in this state, though it is extremely difficult to do so, as the longer an Adjunct is kept in an active Branch, the deeper their ties to the Host and the more powerful the trance. As the Host progresses to berserk then comatose, the Vice core continues its expansion throughout the Host’s body and begins fusing with soft tissue, muscles and organs. If the Branch is not committed or rescinded during this precarious phase, the Vice will initiate the act of dispersion.</p>
                    <p>Dispersion typically occurs in the blink of an eye in an explosive event that often results in electrical surges or power outages. After the Vice core has fused with more than 75% of the Host’s body, the fused parts liquidate and quickly retract in on itself, bringing the rest of the Host’s body towards the center of the core in a grotesque display of cracking bones and squelching organs. The entirety of the Host’s body is compacted inside the core to create an incredibly dense concentration of matter in a two-inch sphere so dark, it absorbs light and looks completely flat.</p>
                    <p>The second that the core initiates this retraction, it dismisses the Adjuncts from the Branch Arena. Adjuncts have at most 3 seconds to distance themselves from the Host, though this is often difficult to do, as the act of dismissal is quite disorienting. The Vice then uses the Host’s body as fuel to disperse hundreds of millions of VG in an explosive, shockwave-like event. Due to their proximity, the bodies of the recently expelled Adjuncts are overwhelmed with the super-charged VG that immediately latch onto and fuse with their organs in incredibly dense collections. The sheer force of dispersion provides these VG with the power to overtake the Adjunct’s body and perform the process of dispersion yet again, sucking the Adjunct’s body into a dense sphere that sends another round of VG out into the ether to infect passersby. This domino effect occurs regardless of the Adjunct’s infection status and drastically increases the reach of VG.</p>
                    <p>Those within an immediate radius but not brought in as Adjuncts are the most susceptible to a higher, but not lethal, concentration of VG. Those as far as 10 meters away are still susceptible to contracting noticeable amounts of VG. Dispersion is generally regarded as a traumatic event, and witnessing a dispersion in person often results in the advent of a Vice, due in large part to the elevated hormone levels from stress and the newly-acquired VG from the nearby dispersion. If a Host is already infected, the influx of VG often excites the Vice and results in a rogue Branch.</p>
                    <p>All things considered, dispersion is relatively uncommon, only observed in the event of unaddressed Branches from particularly intelligent and mature Vices. Refer to Classifying Vices to see which classifications pose a higher threat of dispersion.</p>
                    <h4>Failed Dispersions</h4>
                    <p>While most Vices that initiate dispersion are successful, some less mature or less intelligence Vices have been known to “panic” and prematurely initiate dispersion before 75% or more of the body has been fused with its core. While extremely rare, this results in what is essentially a disemboweling, where the core is only successful in retracting some of the Host’s body. The attempted shockwave is drastically impeded by the mostly still in-tact Host’s body, resulting in a burst of energy that typically shatters the Host’s bones, muscles, and skin. The VG stored for dispersion are still released, but are typically maintained to a finite radius and can be easily cleaned up by a Branch Recovery Specialist. While rare, no Host has ever survived a failed dispersion. Failed rescissions are unlikely, as most Vices that are less mature or less intelligent will resort to other defense mechanisms--such as fusion--before prematurely initiating dispersion.</p>
                    <h3 id="rumen-detachment">Rumen Detachment</h3>
                    <p>Most Vices that manage to create a rumen typically experience rumen detachment at least once in its life cycle. Rumen detachment occurs when a Host strays too far from the established rumen, putting immense strain on the Vice’s rigid stolon, causing it to snap. This removes the drain of nutrients from the Host, often resulting in an inexplicable burst of energy.</p>
                    <p>Immediately, the rumen begins disintegrating, emitting a steady stream of VG into the environment. Because the act of rumen detachment is a relatively low-energy process, the VG expelled tend to hang around the area, permeating a two-meter radius around the disintegrating rumen. Only those that breach the radius are at risk of coming into contact with the VG. Orphaned rumina are typically dealt with using an AV Charge or can be damaged manually using a summoned patch. If a rumen is damaged using a non-AV-charged object, it deploys a behavior similar to core fusion wherein the rumen hardens and becomes extremely brittle. Even gentle touch can trigger a collapse, releasing a cloud of VG into the air.</p>
                    <p>Even attached rumen can be a threat. If you encounter a rumen--attached or detached--please contact Public Deployment, and a Branch Recovery Specialist will be dispatched to address the situation.</p>
                    <h2 id="evolution">Evolution and Intelligence</h2>
                    <p>Though vicology is a relatively new field of study, Vices have grown and evolved immensely during their short time under our observation. In the earliest observed Vices, complex intelligence did not seem to be a present factor, even in more mature Vices. As more Vices facilitate successful dispersions, more unique mixes of VG birth Vices into existence, creating combinations of properties not yet observed, which often lead to entirely new classifications. Learn more in Class Evolution. Vices will only continue to grow and evolve as time moves on, and as they do, so will we. CVRS is dedicated to following the progression of these Vices and is diligently researching ways to combat these invasive, ever-changing creatures.</p>
                    <p>New Vices are tending toward higher threat levels and often tout higher levels of intelligence, leading to a massive increase in recent --gamma subclassifications. Even the Alpha Vices of today seem to be much more intentional in their behavior than their predecessors. Arming yourself with knowledge is imperative, regardless of classification. Vices of any class, in any life stage, can act and react in ways that deviate from expectations, as they are fundamentally animals driven by instinct. The more we learn about these creatures, the more complex they seem to become, operating in methods and realms not previously explored.</p>
                    <p>As these creatures evolve, we need your cooperation and participation in research trials and observatory studies. Visit your local CVRS to begin your treatment plan today and help further the field of Vice research.</p>
