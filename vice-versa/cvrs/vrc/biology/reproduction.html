                    <p>Due to the recent rise in Vice infections, these microscopic spores are found in detectable amounts throughout our world and can even be seen with the naked eye in high concentrations. VG most commonly enter our body through orifices and microscopic tears in the skin, but are small enough to enter through our pores as well. Over time, large concentrations of VG in the body can drastically alter the genetic makeup of soft tissue and benign masses to result in the <a href="./advent.html">birth of a Vice</a>.</p>

                        <p>The passages below contain information that may be uncomfortable for some readers. The act of dispersion entails the mutilation of the human body, which is outlined in detail below. Proceed with caution or <a href="#rumen-detachment">skip to the next section</a>.</p>
                    </div>
                    <h2>Dispersion</h2>
                    <p>Dispersion is a process expressly reserved for reproduction and therefore has the highest return on investment. Dispersion is the result of an unaddressed Branch—one that is not suspended, committed or rescinded. This means that the Branch keeps the Host and any Adjuncts trapped in the Branch Domain while the Vice continues germination and augmentation. Some Adjuncts are capable of exiting the Branch in this state, though it is extremely difficult to do so, as the longer an Adjunct is kept in an active Branch, the deeper their ties to the Host and the more powerful the trance.</p>
                    <p>During a Branch, most Vices pursue either augmentation or germination. Germination is the act of expanding the network, while augmentation entails growing the core. Most classifications pursue germination before augmentation, as a well-established network lays a nutrient-rich path for the core to expand along. While high network density is not required for successful dispersion, it makes the augmentation process much more efficient and provides the growing core with the nutrients needed to continue expanding.</p>
                    <p>If a Branch is allowed to progress for an extended time, the Vice will inevitably begin pursuing excessive augmentation, resulting in a berserk Host. Despite the body’s best efforts, it will not be able to defend against the advancing Vice, which will continue to expand its core until the Branch is addressed. If no action is taken, or if the extensions fail in addressing the Branch, the Vice will expand its core throughout the entirety of the Host’s body, following the network. After it has finished expanding, the core will begin <a href="./defense.html#fusion">fusing</a> with the soft tissue, muscles, and organs nearby, resulting in a comatose Host. Branches can still be addressed at this stage, though the Host is likely to incur significant internal damage. If the Branch remains unaddressed, dispersion begins.</p>
                    <p>Dispersion typically occurs in the blink of an eye, in an explosive event that often results in electrical surges or power outages. After the Vice core has fused with more than 75% of the Host’s body, the fused parts liquidate into a slurry of the expanded core and the Host’s viscera, which is quickly sucked back into the core’s center, bringing the surrounding parts of the Host’s body with it in a grotesque display of cracking bones and squelching organs. The entirety of the Host’s body is compacted inside the core to create an incredibly dense concentration of matter in a two-inch sphere so dark that it absorbs light and appears flat.</p>
                    <p>The second that the core initiates this retraction, it dismisses the Adjuncts from the Branch Domain. Adjuncts have at most 3 seconds to distance themselves from the Host, though this is often difficult to do, as the act of dismissal is quite disorienting.</p>
                    <p>Upon retraction, the Vice then uses the Host’s body as fuel to disperse hundreds of millions of VG in an explosive, shockwave-like event. Due to their proximity, the bodies of the recently expelled Adjuncts are overwhelmed with the super-charged VG that immediately latch onto and fuse with their organs in incredibly dense collections. The sheer force of dispersion provides these VG with the power to overtake the Adjunct’s body and perform the process of dispersion yet again, sucking the Adjunct’s body into a dense sphere that sends another round of VG out into the ether to infect passersby. This domino effect occurs regardless of the Adjunct’s infection status and drastically increases the reach of VG.</p>
                    <p>Those within an immediate radius but not brought in as Adjuncts are the most susceptible to a higher, but not lethal, concentration of VG. Those as far as 10 meters away are still susceptible to contracting noticeable amounts of VG. Dispersion is generally regarded as a traumatic event, and witnessing a dispersion in person often results in the advent of a Vice, due in large part to the elevated hormone levels from stress and the newly-acquired VG from the nearby dispersion. If a Host is already infected, the influx of VG often excites the Vice and results in a rogue Branch.</p>
                    <p>All things considered, dispersion is relatively uncommon, only observed in the event of unaddressed Branches from particularly intelligent and mature Vices. Refer to <a href="../classes/index.html">Classifying Vices</a> to see which classifications pose a higher threat of dispersion.</p>
                    <h3>Failed Dispersions</h3>
                    <p>While most Vices that initiate dispersion are successful, some less mature or less intelligence Vices have been known to “panic” and prematurely initiate dispersion before 75% or more of the body has been fused with its core. While extremely rare, this results in what is essentially a disemboweling, where the core is only successful in retracting some of the Host’s body. The attempted shockwave is drastically impeded by the mostly still in-tact Host’s body, resulting in a burst of energy that typically shatters the Host’s bones, muscles, and skin. The VG stored for dispersion are still released, but are typically confined to a finite radius and can be easily cleaned up by a Branch Recovery Specialist. While rare, no Host has ever survived a failed dispersion. Failed dispersions are unlikely, as most Vices that are less mature or less intelligent will resort to other defense mechanisms--such as fusion--before prematurely initiating dispersion.</p>
                    <h2 id="rumen-detachment">Rumen Detachment</h2>
                    <p>Most Vices that manage to create a rumen typically experience rumen detachment at least once in its life cycle. Rumen detachment occurs when a Host strays too far from the established rumen, putting immense strain on the Vice’s rigid stolon, causing it to snap. This removes the drain of nutrients from the Host, often resulting in an inexplicable burst of energy. Rumen can also be manually detached from the Host by using a patch to sever the stolon.</p>
                    <p>Immediately, the rumen begins disintegrating, emitting a steady stream of VG into the environment. Because the act of rumen detachment is a relatively low-energy process, the VG expelled tend to hang around the area, permeating a two-meter radius around the disintegrating rumen. Only those that breach the radius are at risk of coming into contact with the VG. Orphaned rumina are typically dealt with using an AV Charge or can be damaged manually by using a summoned patch. If a rumen is damaged using a non-AV-charged object, it deploys a behavior similar to <a href="./defense.html#fusion">core fusion</a> wherein the rumen hardens, then becomes extremely brittle. Even gentle touch can trigger a collapse, releasing a cloud of VG into the air.</p>
                    <p>Even attached rumen can be a threat. If you encounter a rumen--attached or detached--please contact Public Deployment, and a Branch Recovery Specialist will be dispatched to address the situation.</p>
