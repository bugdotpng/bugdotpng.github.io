                    <p>An integral facet to understanding Vice biology lies in exploring the properties of Vitiumglomerorum (VG, plural: vitiumglomerora). Over time, our body accumulates these spore-like cells. Due to the recent rise in Vice infections, we come into contact with VG on the daily. Stagnant clouds of VG are unavoidable in public areas with poor airflow, but even outdoor areas have a low, steady level of VG. While wearing a mask can prevent them from being inhaled, VG are still able to enter our body through other orifices, microscopic tears in the skin, and even our pores.</p>
                    <p>Our body is often able to destroy these spores much like it would defend against pollen or a virus by deploying antibodies, raising the body’s temperature, or increasing mucus production. This reaction is typically triggered by large concentrations of VG being introduced to the body&mdash;by a <a href="./reproduction.html#rumen-detachment">detached rumen</a>, for example&mdash;but a steady, gradual increase in VG over time will remain undetected as the body slowly acclimates.</p>
                    <p>Outside of the body, VG are so light that they are able to hang in the air, but once they are in the bloodstream, our plasma activates a “magnetic” property that allows VG to “find” its peers and clump together. This forms a thin, tacky film that can cover soft tissue or non-essential organs like the gallbladder or spleen.</p>
                    <p>Vices prefer to colonize low-traffic areas and generally avoid joints like the shoulder or elbow. They tend to congregate around hormone-producing organs and glands, such as the kidneys, thyroid, or pancreas, but they can also colonize nearby muscles and ligaments. While these clumps are generally benign on their own, heightened exposure to hormones is what ultimately prompts the mass to take root. This process is referred to as a Vice’s advent.</p>

                        </div>
                        <p>The advent of a Vice can be sudden or gradual. Sudden advents are triggered by a single event, while gradual advents occur over an extended period of time. Sudden advents tend to be more common in Vices with a lower threat level, while gradual advents often result in Vices with a higher threat level, though this is not always the case.</p>

                        </div>
                        <p>All Vices are unique, and even those within the same classification can meet milestones at different times. This page covers the general Vice life cycle and outlines expected behaviors and biological changes. Understanding these properties helps to prepare Hosts for any potential changes in activity as the Vice matures.</p>

                        </div>
                        <p>After advent, a Vice immediately begins feeding on the hormones excreted by the Host, preferring those present in high amounts during advent. Vices use these hormones for a wide variety of processes, most commonly contributing to the growth of its core during the larval stage and serving as the energy source of Branch initiation and subsequent augmentation and germination as it matures.</p>

                        <p>Vices are particular creatures, both about their diet and their environment. If either are disturbed or become unreliable, a Vice has many different ways that it takes action to ensure its safety and well-being.</p>

                        </div>
                        <p>Vices use vitiumglomerorum (VG) to reproduce. Once the core has been established, it can work on producing VG to be distributed in various ways, most commonly seen in the act of dispersion, though the detachment of rumen can also aid in reproduction.</p>

Our Research agents are always looking to stay on the cutting edge of Vice evolution, and any unexplained behaviors can help fuel our research endeavors.</p>

                    <p>Though vicology is a relatively new field of study, Vices have grown and evolved immensely during their short time under our observation. In the earliest observed Vices, complex intelligence did not seem to be a present factor, even in more mature Vices. As more Vices facilitate successful dispersions, more unique mixes of VG birth Vices into existence, creating combinations of properties not yet observed, which often lead to anomalies and eventually, entirely new classifications. Learn more in <a href="../classes/index.html#class-evo">Class Evolution</a> or explore our <a href="./anomalies.html">anomaly repository</a>. Vices will only continue to grow and evolve as time moves on, and as they do, so will we. CVRS is dedicated to following the progression of these Vices, and we are diligently researching new ways to combat these invasive, ever-changing creatures.</p>
                    <p>New Vices are tending toward higher threat levels and often tout higher levels of intelligence, leading to a massive increase in recent --gamma subclassifications. Even the Alpha Vices of today seem to be much more intentional in their behavior than their predecessors. We encourage Hosts to arm themselves with knowledge, regardless of classification. Vices of any class, in any life stage, can behave and react in ways that deviate from expectations, as they are fundamentally animals driven by instinct. The more we learn about these creatures, the more complex they seem to become, operating in methods and realms not previously explored.</p>
                    <p>As these creatures evolve, we need the community’s cooperation and participation in research trials and observatory studies. Visit the nearest CVRS to establish a treatment plan today and help further the field of Vice research.</p>
