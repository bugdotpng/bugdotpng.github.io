                    <p>After advent, Vices enter the larval stage. Most Vices do not reach maturity, as rescission is often performed before a Vice can fully mature. Maturity does not always look the same or warrant the same degree of caution between classifications. For example, an adolescent Epsilon Vice typically poses a greater threat than a mature Alpha Vice, and two larval Vices from different classifications can have completely different behavior.</p>
                    <p>Generally speaking, however, mature Vices tend to be more calculated and dangerous than larvae and adolescents. Vices can make attempts to and pursue dispersion at any stage, but it is most commonly executed to completion by mature Vices, while adolescent Vices tend to make the most attempts.</p>

                        <h2>Larval</h2>
                    </div>
                    <p>These young Vices spend the majority of their time storing energy and learning their environment. Branches at this stage are unlikely, as energy is typically directed toward establishing its core and producing VG instead. If a larval Vice does initiate a branch, they have a tendency to prematurely terminate it before the core sustains much damage, as Branches can often be too much of an energy sink for the core to function properly. This is most commonly observed in the initial Branch that occurs from a sudden advent, but it can also occur in subsequent Branches. Larval <a href="../classes/lambda.html">Lambda Vices</a> in particular deviate from this expected behavior, and more can be learned about this life stage on their individual classification page.</p>
                    <p>Vices spend anywhere from 6 months to a year in the larval stage, and can be expected to initiate a Branch anywhere from one to five times, in most cases. Larval cores are relatively small, typically between 10 and 20mm, though they tend to be extremely dense and compact, likely as a defense mechanism. Larval Vices do not have a network and typically present as a circular or oblong mass on a <a href="../../services/primary-care/management-scans.html">VGMS</a>. Below is an example of an unclassified Vice larva.</p>
                    <figure class="captioned-media">
                        <img src="../../images/core-vgms.jpg" alt="a low-resolution black and white image of a vice core, similar in appearance to an ultrasound"/>
                        <figcaption>The above image was taken of an unclassified larval Vice. Denser cores appear closer to solid white, meaning this core in particular is not terribly dense. Due to its shape and density, this is likely an Alpha Vice.</figcaption>
                    </figure>
                    <p>In this stage, many Hosts report uncharacteristic fatigue, brain fog, and elevated hormone production. While Vices do not directly stimulate hormone production, our bodies often begin overcompensating for the percentage ensnared by the core. Extreme cases can result in conditions like hypothyroidism, particularly seen in <a href="../classes/zeta.html">Zeta Vices</a> due to their excessive feeding and specialized biology.</p>
                    <p>Larval Vices avoid setting off the Host’s immune system by using hormones to fuel a steady, gradual core growth that is almost imperceptible and avoids being detected by most immune systems. Even during Branches, growth is minimal, as larval Vices tend to prioritize feeding rather than augmentation.</p>
                    <p>If a Host has a Vice with a gradual advent, many remain unaware of their infection, attributing their uncharacteristic fatigue to illnesses or other factors. Some particularly non-reactive Vices manage to avoid detection into adolescence.</p>
                    <p>Rescission is not commonly pursued at this stage, though it is recommended for some classifications to prevent particularly dangerous Vices from reaching maturity. Hosts with a <a href="../classes/delta.html">Delta</a> or <a href="../classes/zeta.html">Zeta</a> Vice often pursue rescission at this stage for relief, as these classifications can be particularly draining, even moreso than other classifications.</p>
                    <p>Rescission at any stage poses risks, even at the larval stage. <a href="../branches/policies.html">The Branch Policy</a> of a larval Vice has not been determined and cannot be prepared for thoroughly, though the probability of an advanced exhibition and complex Branches are unlikely, save for <a href="../classes/lambda.html">Lambda Vices</a>. Larval cores, too, can sometimes be more defensive, leading to difficulty with rescission.</p>

                        <h2>Adolescent</h2>
                    </div>
                    <p>After a Vice has established its core and familiarized itself with its environment, it will move into the adolescent stage. Using the resources hoarded as a larva, a Vice will being initiating Branches more regularly in an attempt to expand its network (germination) and grow its core (augmentation).</p>
                    <figure class="captioned-media">
                        <img src="#" alt=""/>
                    </figure>
                    <p>Adolescent Vices are visually distinct from larval vices due to the beginnings of a network, which can be seen using a VGMS, though they tend to be faint. During Branches, Vices begin stretching their core, protected by their thickened epithelium as they unfurl from their previously compact state. During this stage, a Vice core can range anywhere from 15mm to 50mm, depending on varying factors such as classification, access to resources, and Branch activity and duration.</p>
                    <p>As the network becomes established, individual tracks are assigned specific duties, with thinner tracks monitoring environmental changes and thicker tracks transporting hormones for feeding. Some tracks are even embedded into organs like lymph nodes, pituitary glands, and even parts of the brain, or are extended outside the body&mdash;known as a stolon&mdash;to monitor a wealth of environmental properties, like temperature, sound, or even relative humidity.</p>
                    <p>Now that the Vice is familiar with the Host’s hormone fluctuations, patterns will begin to emerge in Branch initiation, often tying in to stressful events with properties that mirror those found at advent. The Vice’s newly established network plays an essential role in detecting changes in its environment that instruct the Vice when to best and most effectively initiate Branches.</p>
                    <p>Each Branch requires massive amounts of energy to fuel germination, augmentation, and the creation of the exhibition and Branch Domain, so repeated Branches in quick succession are unlikely. Adolescent Vices are learning how to balance between feeding, growth, and initiating Branches, and they begin observing and documenting their Host’s behavior using their newly established network.</p>
                    <p>Vices typically spend a minimum of two years in the adolescent stage. Some classifications are simply unable to progress to maturity due to their lack of intelligence or ability to plan, but they should not be underestimated. Adolescent Vices are impulsive and inexperienced, but they are likely to initiate rogue Branches that deviate from their Branch Policy. Many are able to take their Host by surprise and capitalize on the prolonged Branch time as the Host regains their footing. Learn more about these rare, but dangerous Branches in <a href="../branches/fringe.html#rogue">Rogue Branches</a>.</p>
                    <p>Generally speaking, a successful rescission is fairly likely in this stage with the right resources thanks to the Vice’s inexperience, but the longer a Vice spends in the adolescent stage, the more experienced and dangerous it becomes. If a Vice is particularly aggressive or deceptive, it is highly encouraged to instigate a Branch and pursue rescission with a support team before it matures further. Browse <a href="../classes/index.html">Classifying Vices</a> for classification-specific rescission guidance at the adolescent stage.</p>
                    <p>An estimated 65% of Vices do not reach maturity; roughly 7% of these Vices are simply incapable of doing so due to their unique characteristics, as seen in Phi Vices. The remaining 58% are rescinded before they are able to reach maturity.</p>

                        <h2>Mature</h2>
                    </div>
                    <p>Vice maturity is marked by considerable expansion along its network, with cores typically ranging from 40mm to 80mm&mdash;though some mature Vices have been documented to be as large as 150mm. Mature Vice networks are much more established, and easily seen with a VGMS or Parsing Goggles. An established network means mature Vices tend to exacerbate blights more than other stages, resulting in more prominent, chronic blights.</p>
                    <figure class="captioned-media">
                        <img src="#" alt=""/>
                    </figure>
                    <p>Mature Vices are also marked by their restraint; that is, demonstrating that they have learned to wait for the opportune time to initiate Branches, rather than initiating Branches every time the environment appears to be suitable.</p>
                    <p>Mature Vices have mastered the art of balancing feeding and Branches, optimizing their energy consumption and growth progress. Quality over quantity is the name of the game with mature Vices. They are much more calculated than adolescents, and while Branches are less common, they’re much more dangerous. Mature Vices tend to wait for the most advantageous opportunities that guarantee longer Branch times, thus ensuring augmentation and/or germination progress, even if the Branch is committed.</p>
                    <p><a href="./energy.html#rumina">Rumina</a> are typically only established by mature Vices, as they require a level of awareness and foresight not typically observed in adolescent Vices. Establishing rumina has become more of a common practice among mature Vices as of late, indicating an increase in overall intelligence. Mature Vices of every classification are capable of establishing a rumen, but it is much more common in those with higher threat levels, seen often in <a href="../classes/zeta.html">Zeta Vices</a>.</p>
                    <p>Rescission in this stage is not guaranteed and will likely require a team of dedicated Adjuncts, no matter the Vice’s classification. Some Vices&mdash;notably Epsilon and Omega Vices&mdash;are capable of obfuscating or even altering their Branch Policy as a defense mechanism, often making for precarious rescissions. Having an established CVRS care team will greatly improve the chances of a successful rescission.
