Additionally, CVRS agents are also capable of joining Branches during production with the use of a proprietary, electrostatic device called a Bypass. Once inside the Branch Domain, Adjuncts can optionally summon a patch and commit or rescind the Branch. Adjuncts are split into four categories: primary, secondary, tertiary, and pseudo.

                            <dd>The birth of a Vice&mdash;categorized as either sudden or gradual&mdash;that officially classifies a Host as infected. Sudden advents occur when the Vice's birth is directly tied to a specific event, and the manifestation of a detectable Vice core immediately follows, often initiating a Branch. Gradual advents occur when the Vice core slowly manifests over time, and no singular event is tied to its creation. The properties present at advent influence the Branch Domain and revisiting these properties often result in Branch initiation.

                            <dd>The human body's natural defense against vitiumglomerorum (VG), AV is the perfect counter-molecule. When an AV particle collides with a VG particle, a small burst of energy is released and both molecules are destroyed. AV can be naturally observed in patches summoned outside of the Branch Domain and glow a bright cyan. While AV are produced by the body naturally, it is often in small amounts and only activated after sudden, drastic changes in VG levels. Artificial AV sources—such as an AV Shot or Summoning Gloves—and regular sessions with an AV Specialist can help boost the body's natural production. Because vitiumnexi (VN) are considered relatively similar in composition to VG, AV are also capable of attacking and nullifying newly-established tracks.

                            <dd>Throughout its life cycle, beginning in adolescence, a Vice will create and establish a network that branches through the Host’s body, originating from its core. When conditions are favorable, most commonly during a Branch when the Host’s immune system is overwhelmed, a Vice will begin the process of augmentation, expanding its core along the nutrient-rich paths of its network. Augmentation is the intended goal of initiating Branches, and this growth paves the way for a Vice to initiate fusion and perform dispersion.

                            <dd>This device floods a Host's body with AV to combat an advancing Vice and is similar in appearance and mechanics to an epinephrine auto-injector. The AV attacks both the Vice’s network and the core; however, AV Shots pose the risk of instigating a Branch, and in the case of mature or intelligent Vices, simply agitate the core and can actually increase growth. AV Shots can be used by CVRS agents to facilitate suspension if needed, and in regular, monitored doses can even facilitate exposure rescission.

While not always, this process often occurs while a Host is trapped in a Branch. Outside of a Branch, a berserk Host (sometimes abbreviated as b!Host) is often unpredictable, and can even be aggressive and hostile as their body is frantically trying to defend against the advancing Vice. The telltale sign of a Berserk Host is uncharacteristically overactive blights. If a berserk Host is left unaddressed, they will become comatose. The safest way to defend against an advancing Vice is to commit (or even rescind) a Branch. Learn more in Host Statuses.</dd>

Blights can be categorized as expulsion, drape, or extrusion blights. Regardless of its type, blights are informed by the Vice’s exhibition and can be a valuable insight into possible changes to the exhibition between Branches. More aggressive blights are indicative of an advancing Vice core and should not be ignored. Learn more in What are Blights?.</dd>

                            <dd>This dissociative phenomenon is the side effect of the overwhelming influx of VG emitted when a Vice attempts the expansion of its core. The term “Branch” encompasses all three stages (initiation, staging and production) and presents the Host with three options: suspending, committing or rescinding the Branch. During production, a Host temporarily loses contact with their body, and their consciousness is transported to the Branch Domain, a metaphysical—but finite and limited—environment where the Vice’s exhibition can be fought. This out-of-body experience is often described as a hallucination or dream, though actions taken in the Branch Domain can have very real consequences. A Vice takes advantage of the Host’s vulnerable state during a Branch by expanding its core along its established network, most commonly resulting in a berserk Host.

                            <dd>This liminal space is where the production stage of a Branch occurs. The domain is comprised of a fabricated environment, the Vice’s exhibition, and extensions of the Host and Adjuncts, as well as their patches. The Branch Domain originates from the Vice core, making the core the true center and the lone corporeal object of the Branch Domain. This environment stays largely the same through a Vice’s life cycle, as its properties draw from those experienced during advent. Over time, this environment can grow to be more complex as the Vice has more energy to devote during staging, though it typically keeps its core components.

A Vice’s Branch Policy stays largely the same throughout its life cycle, and familiarizing oneself with these properties can help lead to a quicker, more efficient rescission. Certain classifications of Vices—namely Delta and Epsilon Vices—intentionally change their Branch Policy over time. Learn more in <a href="./branches/index.html">The Branch Phenomenon</a>.</dd>

Cleared patients can have lingering blights and traces of the previous network, though neither of these pose considerable threats. They often dissipate gradually over time, but can be expedited with the help of Suppressants or a monthly AV Shot. Cleared patients do pose a risk for reignition, but the probability is relatively low. Research suggests that cleared patients have a slightly stronger immune system and consequently require a higher concentration of VG to result in another advent. Learn more in Host Statuses.</dd>

                            <dd>This precarious phase is applied to a Host whose Vice has begun fusing its expanded core with the Host's physical body due to the lack or failure of action during the berserk phase. In this phase, motor control is inhibited and the Vice has flooded the system with lethal amounts of serotonin. High fever, seizures, and heart arrhythmia are indicative of a comatose Host. The Vice core is stretched extremely thin during this process and is incredibly vulnerable to attacks from patches, though attacks do pose a considerable risk to the physical body of the Host due to its fusion with tissue and organs. A comatose Host is unresponsive to the physical world, and any attempts at rescission need to be made swiftly, as Hosts do not last long in this phase. Though rescission does pose potential harm to the Host’s physical form, the benefits of a successful rescission far outweigh the finality of dispersion. Learn more in Host Statuses.</dd>

                            <dd>One of the three potential paths to take during Branches, committing a Branch entails damaging the Vice’s core during production, typically by using a patch. This is the most common action taken during a Branch and is what is recommended if rescission is not attainable. Instigating a Branch is a costly maneuver for the Vice, and when committed, forces the Vice to retract any fresh growth achieved during augmentation to repair its structural integrity. Committing a Branch buys time between Branches as the Vice repairs its core, and often provides the Host or any present Adjuncts with more information to perform a successful rescission.

                            <dd>Understood to be a Vice’s life source, when the core is destroyed, the Vice is rescinded and the Host is cleared. A Vice’s core houses its biological processes, such as energy processing, the . creation of VG, and even sentience, in some cases. The inner-workings of cores are currently unable to be researched due to their defense mechanisms. Vice cores typically reside inside the Host’s physical body, much like a tumor or parasite, and are created when a high concentration of VG is embedded in soft tissue or a benign mass. Many physical and behavioral characteristics of the core differ between classifications. Learn more about its composition in <a href="./vice-biology/index.html">Vice Biology</a>.</dd>

Dismissed Adjuncts are capable of forcing re-entry using a Bypass, but the chances of a successful entry are much lower. Dismissal is typically only observed in mature Vices with a higher threat level, as it is a rather costly maneuver that often sacrifices growth and is only performed if the Vice views the Adjunct as a deadly threat. Primary, secondary, and tertiary Adjuncts can all be dismissed, though the dismissal of primary Adjuncts is highly unlikely. Tertiary Adjuncts are easily expelled without sacrificing much growth, if any, and secondary Adjuncts typically take a bit more effort due to their physical contact. Hosts cannot be dismissed from their Branch. Learn more about Adjuncts in The Role of Adjuncts.</dd>

After the body is completely consumed by the core, it explodes into a fine mist of VG, or fungus-like spores, that can be embedded into those nearby. If a comatose Host is left unaddressed, they will be dispersed. Every Branch poses the risk of dispersion, if not prepared. Learn more about dispersion in Vice Reproduction.</dd>

This process occurs at a near-imperceptible pace, starting in adolescence, and paves the way for augmentation and ultimately dispersion. During Branches, Vices take advantage of the Host’s compromised immune system and perform germination alongside augmentation, though they tend to prioritize one over the other. Prioritizing germination leads to complex networks that typically result in a more efficient, quicker dispersion.

                            <dd>The term “Host” refers to someone infected with a Vice and is most commonly heard in research spaces. The relationship between a Host and their Vice is evident from this terminology, which is often regarded as parasitic. Everyone possesses the ability to become a Host, but the probability fluctuates based on environment, personal characteristics, and past Vice-related encounters. It is estimated that roughly 62% of the population are currently infected with a Vice. Learn more in Host Statuses.</dd>

                            <dd>The network is a mycelium-like collection of tracks that branch throughout the Host’s body, originating from the Vice core. The network monitors physiological changes and collects various hormones or other energy sources to send back to the core where it feeds. During Branches, the core grows and expands along this nutrient-rich path. Particularly established networks tend to be rigid and result in achy joints, even going so far as to restrict range of motion in extreme cases. While the network is predominantly internal, in the case of mature Vices, it can extend beyond the Host’s body--this lone track called a stolon--to create a rumen as an external energy reserve. Networks can be seen through Parsing Goggles and are typically only visible in adolescent and older Vices.

                            <dd>As a dense collection of AV naturally produced by our bodies, patches are understood to be the physical manifestation of our bodies’ attempt to protect us. Not all Hosts obtain patches and they cannot be intentionally created; therefore, lack of patch creation typically suggests a Vice with a lower threat level. Research posits that patches are only created when the Host is in danger, typically triggered by sudden changes in the physiology of the Vice core, such as resource hoarding or exponential network expansion. Patches range in appearance and function and often resemble weapons or defenses, designed especially to counter the Vice’s exhibition. Learn more in AV and Patches.</dd>

                            <dd>Rescission is the act of destroying a Vice’s core, either manually or with the use of a patch. This is most commonly achieved during a Branch, but fringe cases have reported the manual destruction of a Vice core through extreme measures, such as self mutilation or surgical intervention. Upon achieving successful rescission, a Host is labeled as cleared, with a low possibility of reignition. Lingering blights are not uncommon, and can be treated with the help of Suppressants or monthly AV Shots.

                            <dd>Typically observed in Vices with a higher threat level, rumina are external resource hoards where a Vice stores extra energy gathered from a Host, typically during times of excess. It is connected to the Vice core through a densely-packed collection of external tracks, sometimes  visible to the naked eye. A Vice can disconnect from its rumen at any time, most commonly observed when a Host strays too far from the rumen and puts too much of a strain on the tracks. Vices discourage its Host from straying too far by drastically increasing the rumen’s energy consumption the closer a Host gets to reaching the limit of the established tracks. Because of this, many Hosts with a rumen report symptoms such as depression, fatigue, executive dysfunction, and muscle or joint stiffness. Detached rumina are capable of surviving separate from their Host for a few weeks, depending on their size, and gradually disintegrate over time, releasing a steady flow of VG. A detached rumen is able to reattach if the Host is back in proximity for an established length of time, typically around a week. Learn more in Establishing Rumina.</dd>

                            <dd>This prescription drug increases the body’s creation of AV and blocks the primary source of blights, typically an overabundance of histamines and VG in the Host’s system. While many Hosts do report relief, Vice Management Administrators prefer to address the root of the problem with Branch management. Suppressants are also understood to dampen symptoms and mask the true status of the Host. Some Hosts have even unknowingly become berserk while on suppressants, with their symptoms presenting more like mania without the added context of agitated blights. Use with caution.

                            <dd>One of three potential paths to take during Branches, suspending a Branch entails threatening the Vice core while the Branch is being staged, by using either an AV Shot or patch. This is typically ill-advised, as doing so often agitates the Vice and results in more frequent Branches, among many other downsides. Suspension should only be performed as a last result, particularly to buy more time to prepare. Learn more in Branch Options.</dd>

New tracks are extremely fluid and easily damaged, but as they become more established, a thick epithelium can form as a rigid, protective layer from AV. While the primary purpose of tracks is to monitor surroundings and send nutrients back to the core, it is also the path that the core expands along during a Branch. Collectively, the tracks are known as the Vice’s network. Learn more about networks and their purpose in <a href="./vice-biology/index.html">Vice Biology</a>.</dd>

                            <dd>VG are extremely light, spore-like cells expelled by the Vice core as a form of reproduction. While dispersion is their preferred method, VG can also be expelled by rumina in smaller concentrations. Due to the recent rise in Vice infections, VG are found in detectable amounts throughout our world and can even be seen with the naked eye in high concentrations. VG most commonly enter our body through orifices and microscopic tears in the skin, but are small enough to enter through our pores as well. Over time, large concentrations of VG in the body can drastically alter the genetic makeup of soft tissue and benign masses to result in the birth of a Vice. Learn more in Vice Reproduction.</dd>

                            <dd>VN are the unique, extremely small cells that make up the majority of tracks in the Vice’s network. VN have proven to be difficult to study, as other Vice-specific molecules have, due in large part to both their size and Vices’ reactivity and defense mechanisms. What we do know is that these molecules relay rudimentary environmental information back to the core, while also receiving core feedback to expand in times of excess or retract in times of scarcity. Because tracks are so densely packed with VN, their form is relatively porous and can shift its outer layer of VN to ensnare passing hormones with a net-like configuration and send them back to the core for processing.
