                    <p>This dissociative phenomenon is the side effect of the overwhelming influx of vitiumglomerorum (VG) emitted when a Vice attempts the expansion of its core or network. The term “Branch” encompasses all three stages (initiation, staging and production) and presents the Host with three options: suspending, committing or rescinding the Branch. During production, a Host temporarily loses contact with their body, and their consciousness is transported to the Branch Domain, a metaphysical—but finite and limited—environment where the Vice’s exhibition can be fought and the core can be damaged. This out-of-body experience is often described as a hallucination or dream, though actions taken in the Branch Domain can have very real consequences.</p>
                    <p>As explored in <a href="../biology/index.html">Vice Biology</a>, Vices feed on our hormones, most commonly indulging in those released during high-stress situations such as cortisol, adrenaline, and norepinephrine. They often wait for particularly triggering situations where these hormone levels are elevated. Once the Vice detects the sharp increase in hormones, it performs an environmental check, then releases VG from its core to sedate the Host and begin to expand its core or network undeterred.</p>
                    <p>Branches are comprised of three phases: initiation, staging, and production, each explored in detail in <a href="./phases.html">Branch Phases</a>. Collectively, the details of these stages are part of a Vice’s Branch Policy, a relatively static set of criteria and behaviors that can help a Host prepare for and even avoid future Branches. The Branch Policy includes the environmental Branch trigger(s), the Branch Domain blueprint, exhibition presentation and attack strategy, as well as the core priorities outside of the Branch Domain. Learn more in <a href="./policies.html">Branch Policies</a>.</p>
                    <p>A Host is likely to experience anywhere from 10 to 30 Branches in a single Vice’s life cycle. Larval Vices are less likely to initiate Branches, if at all, while adolescent Vices tend to be quite impulsive and initiate the majority of Branches in a Vice’s life cycle. Mature Vices tend to exhibit more discernment and are more thoughtful before initiating Branches.</p>
                    <h2>Branch Mechanics</h2>
                    <p>Branches are an incredibly complex phenomenon with many aspects that are still under rigorous observation. The mechanics outlined below can help provide a clearer understanding of what to expect if one finds themself in a Branch.</p>

                        <p>Branches are comprised of three phases—initiation, staging, and production—each having unique properties that can serve the Host and Adjuncts valuable information that can aid in future Branches and even inform rescission tactics.</p>

                        </div>
                        <p>Every Vice has a set of relatively static data that influences Branches, known collectively as the Branch Policy. This data is typically established at advent and tends to remain generally the same throughout a Vice’s life cycle, though some properties can increase in complexity.</p>

                        <p>Hosts and Adjuncts have three options when encountering a Branch, depending on the Branch phase. During staging, an Adjunct can suspend the Branch, and during production the Host or an Adjunct can commit or rescind the Branch.</p>

                        </div>
                        <p>Only present in the Branch Domain, a Vice's exhibition shields the vulnerable core from the Host, Adjuncts and their patches. Exhibitions also influence blights, as many properties present in the exhibition are mirrored as blights, most commonly seen as horns, teeth or skin textures. Exhibitions are incredibly unique and vary greatly between Hosts, though experts have begun grouping them by size and Branch strategy.</p>

                        <p>While it is possible to address Branches alone, many Hosts benefit from the support that Adjuncts can offer. Adjuncts can increase the success rates, typically by strengthening defenses, increasing firepower, or even serving as a distraction. Adjuncts can be classified as primary, secondary, or tertiary.</p>
