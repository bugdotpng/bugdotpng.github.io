                    <p>Every Vice has a set of relatively static data that influences Branches, known collectively as the Branch Policy. This data is typically established at advent and tends to remain generally the same throughout a Vice’s life cycle, though some increase in complexity. Some classifications&mdash;specifically <a href="../classes/delta.html">Delta</a> and <a href="../classes.epsilon.html">Epsilon</a> Vices&mdash;are able to intentionally change these properties as a defense mechanism or to catch the Host by surprise. Each subset of data is further outlined below.</p>
                    <p>Contrary to popular belief, the time between Branches is not part of a Vice’s Branch Policy, and is instead influenced by the method used in addressing the Branch (suspension vs commit) and how much the core was damaged. Learn more about this relationship in Branch Options. Additionally, different classifications and Vices in different life stages can have varying preferences. For example, larval Epsilon Vices initiate almost no Branches at all, while adolescent Alpha Vices can initiate Branches bi-weekly. Learn more about these expected behaviors in <a href="../classes/index.html">Classifying Vices</a>.</p>
                    <p>A Vice’s Branch Policy is comprised of the following properties, each further explained below:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><a href="#triggers">Environmental Branch Trigger(s)</a>: the environmental conditions present during advent</li>
                        <li><a href="#domain">Branch Domain Blueprint</a>: the layout of the Branch Domain</li>
                        <li><a href="#exhibition">Exhibition Presentation</a>: the exhibitions makeup, its features, and how it functions</li>
                        <li><a href="#strategy">Exhibition Attack Strategy</a>: how the exhibition behaves in the Branch Domain</li>
                        <li><a href="#priorities">Core Priorities</a>: overall, which process the Vice devotes the most energy towards</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h2 id="triggers">Environmental Branch Trigger(s)</h2>
                    <p>This set of information is established at advent and is referenced during the Quality Assurance Check (QAC) before a Branch. If the current properties of the Host’s environment match at minimum three of the properties found at advent, the Vice will proceed with Branch initiation. Examples of these properties most commonly include sounds and smells, but can even include temperature and the amount of natural light. Learn more about QACs in <a href="./phases.html#qac">Phase 0: Quality Assurance Check</a>.</p>
                    <h2 id="domain">Branch Domain Blueprint</h2>
                    <p>As discussed in The Metaphysical Realm, the layout of the Branch Domain typically pulls inspiration from the environment around the Host at advent. In the case of a gradual advent, the blueprint often begins as a simple arena, but evolves over time and becomes more complex, some even containing multiple stages or rooms the Vice can switch between during production.</p>
                    <p>Small details of the Branch Domain are less detailed or difficult to parse when observed directly, much like the details of a dream. The overall blueprint of the Branch Domain stays roughly the same throughout a Vice’s life cycle, but can and often does increase in complexity as the Vice matures, especially for those with a gradual advent or a higher threat level.</p>
                    <p>Some classifications are capable of constructing novel blueprints to better suit their exhibition, but this is only observed in extremely intelligent Vices with a higher threat level&mdash;such as Omega and Epsilon Vices.</p>
                    <h2 id="exhibition">Exhibition Presentation</h2>
                    <p>Only present in the Branch Domain, a Vice's exhibition shields the vulnerable core from the Host, Adjuncts and their patches. Exhibitions typically take the form of predatory animals—though the possibilities are endless. Some exhibitions are comprised of the properties present at advent, typically textures, smells or sounds and can even draw from the innate fears of the Host. The characteristics of the exhibition are also influenced by its attack strategy, and vice versa, an example being how defensive exhibitions typically have a thicker skin or protective outer shell.</p>
                    <p>Exhibitions are incredibly unique and vary greatly between Hosts, but tend to stay roughly the same throughout a Vice’s life cycle. As with the Branch Domain blueprint, a Vice’s exhibition can increase in complexity as the Vice matures. Exhibitions can be classified by size, and tend to stay in the same size grouping, even as complexity increases. Learn more about exhibitions in <a href="./exhibitions.html">Exploring Exhibitions</a>.</p>
                    <h2 id="strategy">Exhibition Attack Strategy</h2>
                    <p>This data set is relatively broad and refers to a Vice’s M.O., that is, how the Vice interacts with the Host and Adjuncts within the Branch Domain. This attack strategy informs how the exhibition is classified, as offensive, defensive, hasty, or balanced. A Vice’s attack strategy is not directly tied to its classification, thought most classes tend to see higher concentrations of specific exhibition attack strategies. For example, Theta Vices typically have hasty exhibitions while Zeta Vices almost exclusively have defensive exhibitions.</p>
                    <p>Attack strategy also refers to the literal plan of attack once the Branch moves into production. This data is extremely broad, as every exhibition is different, but includes preferences such as which extensions the exhibition targets and how the exhibition interacts with the Branch Domain&mdash;if it uses objects or hides behind them. These preferences also include the core reactivity or how much damage the core allows before terminating a Branch. Learn more about exhibitions in <a href="./exhibitions.html">Exploring Exhibitions</a>.</p>
                    <h2 id="priorities">Core Priorities</h2>
                    <p>Once a Branch is initiated, the Vice core will pursue two options, germination or core augmentation. Classifications tend to be a good indicator of which option a Vice will prefer, though it is not a hard and fast rule. Vices can also pursue both simultaneously, though overall progress in each will be sacrificed.</p>
                    <p>Germination is the process of expanding the network, a series of VN-packed tracks that extend throughout the Host’s body. Prioritizing this process lays the groundwork for a more efficient and successful dispersion, as a well-established network is key to acquiring as much fuel as possible. Core augmentation is the process of physically expanding the core along these established tracks. Growth otherwise occurs at a near-imperceptible rate so as to not trip the Host’s immune system. Core augmentation is necessary to enact dispersion, so periods of unrestrained growth contribute immensely to that goal.</p>
                    <p>Though both germination and core augmentation are often prioritized, a Vice will always have a preference, and this preference can influence Branch frequency, feeding and storage habits, and the expected behaviors to look out for prior to the Vice pursuing dispersion. Learn more about these priorities and what they imply for each classification in Classifying Vices.</p>
