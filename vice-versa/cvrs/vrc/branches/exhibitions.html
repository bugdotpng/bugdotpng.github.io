                        <p>Only present in the Branch Domain, a Vice's exhibition shields the vulnerable core from the Host, Adjuncts and their patches. Exhibitions also influence blights, as many properties present in the exhibition are mirrored as blights, most commonly seen as horns, teeth or skin textures. Exhibitions are incredibly unique and vary greatly between Hosts, though experts have begun grouping them by size and Branch strategy.</p>

                    <p>Within the Branch Domain, a Host and their Adjunct(s) are pitted against the Vice’s exhibition, a creature-like visage that shields the Vice’s core from attacks. When a Branch is in production, the most surefire way to address the Branch is to either damage or destroy the Vice’s core, which entails sparring with the Vice’s exhibition.</p>
                    <p>The exhibition houses the Vice’s core, which is stored in the same place for every Branch. Hosts and Adjuncts can use hand-to-hand combat to damage the core, but, if established, their patches are much more efficient. Patches are created to be direct counters to a Host’s exhibition; for example, if a Vice’s exhibition has a thick hide, a piercing patch is likely to be established. Learn more about patches in <a href="./bodies/index.html#av">AV and Patches</a>.</p>
                    <p>Exhibitions are capable of resembling anything the mind can conjure, though they typically resemble predatory animals or grotesque amalgamations akin to monsters in horror movies. Exhibitions can be as small as an armadillo or tower over a house. Size and complexity do have limits, however, typically capped by the Vice’s energy reserves. Some classifications prioritize complex and grand exhibitions, while others prefer to focus more on their plan of attack.</p>
                    <p>The characteristics of an exhibition are largely determined at advent, either pulling from internalized fears or from the Host’s experience during advent, both of which can influence the exhibition’s textures, body composition, and even smell. Exhibitions do not have to be bipedal, nor do they even need to have legs at all. Exhibitions can have wings, tails, spines, multiple sets of eyes, multiple heads, and multiple sets of limbs. Exhibitions can mimic insects, aquatic animals, birds, and even extinct species or creatures from pop culture like kaiju or cryptids. The possibilities truly are endless.</p>
                    <p>Most exhibitions remain largely the same throughout a Vice’s life cycle, only increasing in complexity as it matures. Because of this, a Vice’s exhibition is part of its <a href="#policies">Branch Policy</a>. Typically, Vices do not make drastic changes to their exhibitions between Branches, as it is an energy-intensive task to perform; though, some classifications have perfected the ability and are known for doing so, namely <a href="./classes/delta.html">Delta</a> and <a href="./classes/epsilon.html">Epsilon</a> Vices. Learn more about the differing exhibition properties between classifications in <a href="./classes/index.html">Classifying Vices</a>.</p>
                    <p>Exhibitions also influence blights, and characteristics observed in the Branch Domain can be seen mirrored in the Host, manifested through blights. For example, if a Vice’s exhibition has horns, is covered in scales, and can spit acid, the Host is likely to have similar horns, patches of scales, and acidic saliva. Learn more about blights in <a href="./bodies/index.html#blights">What are Blights?</a>.</p>
                    <h2>Exhibition Properties</h2>
                    <p>Branch Analysts have devised broad categories for documentation and preparatory purposes. These categories largely influence treatment plans and can help agents and Hosts prepare plans of attack.</p>
                    <p>While size is not necessarily indicative of threat level, larger exhibitions often require a larger treatment team. Size in this instance refers to height, not weight. Exhibition sizes are categorized using the following prefixes:</p>
                    <dl class="desc-list desc-list--feature four-col">
                        <div class="desc-list__item">
                            <dt>Micro-</dt>
                            <dd>Micro-exhibitions are at most two feet tall. Hosts can typically address these exhibitions alone.</dd>
                        </div>
                        <div class="desc-list__item">
                            <dt>Meso-</dt>
                            <dd>Meso-exhibitions are between two and five feet tall. Hosts will benefit from the help of at least one Adjunct, typically two.</dd>
                        </div>
                        <div class="desc-list__item">
                            <dt>Macro-</dt>
                            <dd>Macro-exhibitions are between five and eight feet tall. Hosts will benefit from the help of at least three Adjuncts.</dd>
                        </div>
                        <div class="desc-list__item">
                            <dt>Giga-</dt>
                            <dd>Giga-exhibitions are eight feet or taller. Hosts will likely need a large, specially-curated team of at least five Adjuncts.</dd>
                        </div>
                    </dl>
                    <p>Exhibitions can also be classified by their prioritized stats. This classification informs the types of patches needed for efficiently addressing the Branch, and helps agents better formulate their plans of attack. The core purpose of exhibitions is to trap a Host and their Adjuncts in the Branch Domain as the core pursues germination and augmentation. The method in which they are able to do so is indicated by these categories and is a facet of the Vice’s <a href="#policies">Branch Policy</a>.</p>
                    <dl class="desc-list mb-lg">
                        <dt>Offensive</dt>
                        <dd>Many offensive exhibitions prioritize attack over defense, and are typically regarded as “glass canons”. They hit hard, but they are likely unable to take a hit. Some offensive exhibitions put resources in speed at the expense of their attack, while still predominantly prioritizing attack. An offensive exhibition’s plan is to damage the Host and Adjuncts early so they are unable to fight back.</dd>
                        <dt>Defensive</dt>
                        <dd>Defensive exhibitions typically do not focus on attacking extensions; rather, their aim is to put so much stock in their defense that the Host and Adjuncts are unable to make considerable progress in a timely manner, essentially trapping them in the Branch Domain as the Vice pursues germination and augmentation.</dd>
                        <dt>Hasty</dt>
                        <dd>These speedy exhibitions prioritize confusion and frustration with a “death by a thousand cuts” approach. While these exhibitions typically cannot hit hard, they hit often and avoid attacks with their elusive dodging. Some hasty exhibitions go so far as to even avoid combat altogether, hiding among detailed Branch Domains.</dd>
                        <dt>Balanced</dt>
                        <dd>Regarded as the “jack of all trades” classification, these exhibitions are actually the most dangerous, as they are able to switch plans of attack within an active Branch in reaction to the Host’s strategy. If a Host and Adjuncts are on the offensive, it can prioritize defenses, and switch to a hasty or offensive approach after they have been worn down. Balanced exhibitions are often macro- or giga-exhibitions and typically require larger treatment teams with the  added support of a <a href="#">Solutions Architect</a>.</dd>
                    </dl>
                    <p>While the specific details of exhibitions vary widely even within the same classification, most exhibitions within a classification share the same high-level properties explored above. For example, an Alpha Vice is likely to have a meso-offensive exhibition, while a Zeta Vice is almost guaranteed to have a giga-defensive exhibition. Learn about these shared exhibition properties in <a href="./classes/index.html">Classifying Vices</a>.</p>
