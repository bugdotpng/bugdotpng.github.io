                        <p>While it is possible to address Branches alone, many Hosts benefit from the support that Adjuncts can offer. Adjuncts can increase the success rates, typically by strengthening defenses, increasing firepower, or even serving as a distraction. Adjuncts can be classified as primary, secondary, or tertiary.</p>

                    <p>Primary and secondary Adjuncts are queued during staging via physical touch, while tertiary Adjuncts are brought in during staging by a Vice extending its tracks. Adjuncts are admitted to production after the Host has entered the Branch Domain. Primary and secondary Adjuncts must maintain contact with the Host during both staging and production. Due to their lack of contact, tertiary Adjuncts are often dismissed from Branches.</p>
                    <dl class="desc-list">
                        <dt>Tertiary Adjunct <small>(t!Adjunct)</small></dt>
                        <dd>
                            <p>Tertiary Adjuncts are a relatively rare phenomenon, and are often unassuming strangers brought into Branches by a Vice to throw off the Host and increase energy consumption if a Vice is confident in reaching dispersion. These Adjuncts are typically only associated with specific Vice classifications, such as Theta Vices, or intelligent, calculating Vices, as the act of queuing and maintaining “contact” with tertiary Adjuncts is quite energy-intensive.</p>
                            <p>The Vice extends its tracks to latch on to those within the staging radius, though the connection is weak during staging and can be easily lost, so Vices tend to employ this tactic  right before production. After these Adjuncts are admitted to the Branch Domain, their connection is somewhat solidified, though still relatively easy to break free from, which often occurs before the Branch is addressed. Tertiary Adjuncts cannot summon patches in the Branch Domain due to this weak connection. A Vice is also capable of easily expelling a tertiary Adjunct if they become too much of a threat, known as dismissal.</p>
                        </dd>
                        <dt>Secondary Adjunct <small>(s!Adjunct)</small></dt>
                        <dd>Secondary Adjuncts are the most common, spanning anywhere from someone who is attending a Host's Branch for the first time to people who have been admitted to more than five. These Adjuncts are intentionally brought into Branches via physical touch while the  Branch is being staged. Secondary Adjuncts are capable of summoning  patches and are less likely to be dismissed, though it is still possible for less experienced Adjuncts. The more often a secondary Adjunct is brought in, the stronger the connection becomes. Though the number  varies between Hosts, after a secondary Adjunct has made several contributions to the success of Branches, be it analyzing the Branch Policy or facilitating commits, they are reclassified as a primary Adjunct. The number of Branches an Adjunct has been admitted to does not determine their classification; rather, their connection to the Host and situational awareness within the Branch Domain sets these Adjuncts apart.</dd>
                        <dt>Primary Adjunct <small>(p!Adjunct)</small></dt>
                        <dd>
                            <p>Primary Adjuncts have regularly aided in committing Branches for a Host and have a firm grasp of its Branch Policy. Because of this, primary Adjuncts are less common, but they are invaluable during Branches and rescission, especially. Many Vice Management Administrators quickly become a primary Adjunct for their patients after thorough analysis of their Branch Policy.</p>
                            <p>Due to their stronger connection, Primary Adjuncts are more difficult to dismiss, have a boost to their patch's efficacy, and have a higher success rate when forcing entry with a Bypass. Trust and confidence are integral in setting primary Adjuncts apart and play a large role in bolstering their connection to the Host during Branches. Because of this bond, primary Adjuncts are often able to perform fringe actions with the Host, such as merging patches, forcing entry, and even summoning reformed Vices more easily.</p>
                        </dd>
                        <dt>Pseudo Adjunct</dt>
                        <dd>
                            <p>While not common in everyday Branches, CVRS utilizes pseudo Adjuncts to observe Branches from a distance and document Vice behavior and Branch properties. Solutions Architects in  particular are brought in to detect weaknesses in a Vice's exhibition and pick up on patterns in early Branches, relaying this information to Vice Management Administrators and Branch Admins.</p>
                            <p>These agents are able to join Branches via proximity, using a modified Bypass with a lower electrical charge. This lower charge and their lack of contact with the Host result in a fairly weak but nearly undetectable presence in the Branch Domain. Most Vices do not notice a pseudo Adjunct's presence in the Branch Domain as their visage is often nearly transparent and amorphous. They also cannot have a direct impact on the Branch and are only able to communicate with the primary and secondary Adjuncts or external agents using a MobiComm.</p>
                        </dd>
                    </dl>
                    <h2 id="admission" class="mt-lg">The Admission Process</h2>
                    <p>The process of admitting primary and secondary Adjuncts to a Branch is not unlike a queue, where making contact with the Host is similar to reserving one's space in line. Adjuncts are admitted to the Branch Domain in the same order they were added to the queue during staging, with a 1:4 ratio for wait times. That is to say, if an Adjunct joined the queue 15 seconds into staging, they would be admitted roughly a minute after the Host is admitted to the Branch Domain.</p>
                    <p>If contact is interrupted, the Adjunct is sent to the back of the queue. If the Branch is somehow committed or rescinded while an Adjunct is in the queue, they are simply dismissed from the Branch. Adjuncts can be admitted simultaneously if contact was made at the same time, though primary Adjuncts tend to be admitted slightly sooner.</p>
                    <p>If an unpredictable Branch has been initiated and all Adjuncts do not have time to make contact with the Host, making contact with each other will suffice, so long as at least one Adjunct is in contact with the Host. Doing so creates an exponentially staggered queuing effect of bringing in Adjuncts, where Adjuncts that are two or three times removed from the Host can take up to an hour of in-Branch time to be brought in.</p>
                    <p>The key to Branch admission lies in making direct physical contact with the Host. At Branch initiation, the tightly-packed, neutrally-charged VN making up the tracks of a Vice’s network are electrified, temporarily exuding a positive charge. This compromises the track structure as the molecules repel each other and allows the VG previously stored in the tracks to leech into the Host’s bloodstream. If a person makes contact during this time, the human body acts as a conductor and expands the positively-charged electromagnetic field to include them. Breaking contact removes the flow of electricity and dismisses the Adjunct from the queue during staging, or from the Branch Domain during production.</p>
                    <h2 id="benefits">The Benefits of Employing Adjuncts</h2>
                    <p>The chart below shows how the number of secondary Adjuncts present in the Branch Domain increases the chances of success. The higher the threat level, the more Adjuncts required for higher rates of success. This increased rate of success extends to both committing and rescinding Branches.</p>
