                    <p>First discovered by a nurse via ultrasound in 1973, a Vicemortiferum [VEE-seh-mohr-TI-fehr-um] (plural: Vicemortifera) or more commonly known as a "Vice", is a parasitic creature that draws its energy from the products of our body’s endocrine system. They feed and grow from many of the hormones released as we live our lives, such as cortisol, adrenaline, and epinephrine. Their origins remain largely unknown, as they are suspected to have been quietly living among us before their discovery. In the 70s, cases were so rare that they were considered medical anomalies, but over time, we have seen a steady increase in cases and roughly 62% of the population are estimated to be infected with a Vice.</p>
                    <p>The presence of a Vice is at best, inconsequential, and at worst, lethal; though, the advent of a Vice is not necessarily a death sentence. In fact, the majority of Hosts live long, full lives with their Vice, and many with less severe Vice classifications are able to keep them under control on their own. Regardless, Hosts—especially those with more severe classifications—are encouraged to enlist the help of an Adjunct(s) or Vice Management Specialist to establish a support system as early in the process as possible. Call us at (214) 877-8423 or email <a href="mailto:bugdotinfo@gmail.com">info@cvrs.com</a> to schedule a consult at a Primary Care near you.</p>
                    <p>During a Vice’s life cycle, a Host will become accustomed to the phenomenon known as a Branch, wherein the Vice floods the Host’s body with vitiumglomerorum—spore-like molecules that inhibit  the immune system and facilitate Vice reproduction—and traps the Host’s consciousness in a dream-like environment while it attempts to spread throughout the body. Hosts are able to rid their body of their Vice through the process of rescission, where they destroy the Vice core during an active Branch. The process of rescission looks different between different classifications of Vices, but can generally be prepared for by observing a Vice's behavior in previous Branches. This compendium covers rescission and the different ways that Branches can be addressed if rescission is not immediately possible.</p>
