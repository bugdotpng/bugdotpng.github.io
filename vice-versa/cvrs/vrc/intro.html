                    <p>First discovered by a nurse via ultrasound in 1973, a Vicemortiferum [VEE-seh-mohr-TI-fehr-um] (plural: Vicemortifera) or more commonly known as a "Vice", is a parasitic creature that draws its energy from the products of our body’s endocrine system. They feed and grow from many of the hormones released as we live our lives, such as cortisol, adrenaline, and epinephrine. Their origins remain largely unknown, as they are suspected to have been quietly living among us before their discovery. In the 70s, cases were so rare that they were considered medical anomalies, but over time, we have seen a steady increase in cases and roughly 62% of the population are estimated to be infected with a Vice. While a true immunity is not currently known, stronger immune systems seem to be able to fight off vitiumglomerorum&mdash;the spore-like vehicle of Vice reproduction, also known as VG.</p>
                    <p>The presence of a Vice is at best, inconsequential, and at worst, lethal; though, the advent of a Vice is not necessarily a death sentence. In fact, the majority of Hosts live long, full lives with their Vice, and many with less severe Vice classifications are able to keep them under control on their own. There are currently 10 primary classifications and 4 secondary classifications (subclasses), all with differing behaviors, characteristics, and even biology. Learn more about these in <a href="./classes/index.html">Classifying Vices</a>.</p>
                    <p>Regardless of classification, Hosts—especially those with more severe classifications—are encouraged to enlist the help of an Adjunct(s) or Vice Management Administrator to establish a support system as early in the process as possible. Call us at (214) 877-8423 or email <a href="mailto:info@cvrs.com">info@cvrs.com</a> to schedule a consult at a <a href="../services/primary-care/index.html">Primary Care</a> near you.</p>
                    <p>Vices have three stages in their life cycle: larval, adolescent, and mature. While all Vices are different, especially between classifications, specific behaviors tend to mark each life stage. Larvae are generally inactive and primarily focus on feeding. Adolescents drastically increase Branch activity and are generally regarded as more impulsive and aggressive. Mature Vices tend to be more calculated and discerning in initiating Branches. <a href="./classes/index.html">Classifying Vices</a> goes into detail about what one can expect to see in each life stage for each of the 10 classifications.</p>
                    <p>A common side effect of a Vice infection is the manifestation of <a href="./bodies/blights.html">blights</a>, which can be arranged into three categories: expulsion, drape, and extrusion. Expulsion blights&mdash;like smoke, for example&mdash;often manifest at advent and can be seen through all life stages. Drape and extrusion blights, however, only manifest after an adolescent Vice begins creating its network, a mycelial-like web of tracks. These tracks help transport VG and send captured hormones back to the core for the Vice to feed. As the network becomes more complex, the concentrations of VG can spur drape blights (scales or feathers) and extrusion blights (horns or claws) to manifest.</p>
                    <p>During a Vice’s life cycle, a Host will become accustomed to the phenomenon known as a <a href="./branches/index.html">Branch</a>, wherein the Vice floods the Host’s body with VG and traps the Host’s consciousness in a dream-like environment while it attempts to expand either its core (augmentation) or network (germination) throughout the body. Hosts are able to rid their body of their Vice through the process of rescission, where they destroy the Vice core during an active Branch. The process of rescission looks different between different classifications of Vices, but can generally be prepared for by observing a Vice's behavior in previous Branches, which can be addressed with a commit or suspension. Learn about the different ways to address a Branch in <a href="./branches/options.html">Branch Options</a>.</p>
