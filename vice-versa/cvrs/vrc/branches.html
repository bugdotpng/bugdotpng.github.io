                    <p>This dissociative phenomenon is the side effect of the overwhelming influx of vitiumglomerorum (VG) emitted when a Vice attempts the expansion of its core or network. The term “Branch” encompasses all three stages (initiation, staging and production) and presents the Host with three options: suspending, committing or rescinding the Branch. During production, a Host temporarily loses contact with their body, and their consciousness is transported to the Branch Arena, a metaphysical—but finite and limited—environment where the Vice’s exhibition can be fought and the core can be damaged. This out-of-body experience is often described as a hallucination or dream, though actions taken in the Branch Arena can have very real consequences.</p>
                    <p>As explored in <a href="./biology.html">Vice Biology</a>, Vices feed on our hormones, most commonly indulging in those released during high-stress situations such as cortisol, adrenaline, and norepinephrine. They often wait for particularly triggering situations where these hormone levels are elevated. Once the Vice detects the sharp increase in hormones, it performs an environmental check, then releases VG from its core to sedate the Host and begin to expand its core or network undeterred.</p>
                    <p>Branches are comprised of three phases: initiation, staging, and production, each explored in detail in <a href="#phases">Branch Phases</a>. Collectively, the details of these stages are part of a Vice’s Branch Policy, a relatively static set of criteria and behaviors that can help a Host prepare for and even avoid future Branches. The Branch Policy includes the environmental Branch trigger(s), the Branch Arena blueprint, exhibition presentation and attack strategy, as well as the core priorities outside of the Branch Arena. Learn more in <a href="#policies">Branch Policies</a> below.</p>
                    <p>A Host is likely to experience anywhere from 10 to 30 Branches in a single Vice’s life cycle. Larval Vices are less likely to initiate Branches, if at all, while adolescent Vices tend to be quite impulsive and initiate the majority of Branches in a Vice’s life cycle. Mature Vices tend to exhibit more discernment and are more thoughtful before initiating Branches.</p>

                            <p>Branches are comprised of three phases--initiation, staging, and production--each having unique properties that can serve the Host and Adjuncts valuable information that can aid in future Branches and even inform rescission tactics.</p>
                            <p>The properties outlined below are most commonly found in Alpha and Beta Vices. While all Vices construct triphasic Branches, certain characteristics of these phases can vary between classifications, as explored in the individual classification pages under <a href="./classes/index.html">Classifying Vices</a>.</p>

                                    <span class="superhead">Phase 0</span>
                                    <h3 id="qac">Quality Assurance Check (QAC)</h3>
                                </div>
                                <p>Adolescent and mature Vices run a quick quality assurance check (QAC) after the core detects an increase in its desired hormone. All Branches must follow an increase in hormones, but not all hormone increases result in a Branch. A QAC is comprised of two checks, first assessing the status of the Host’s body, then the external environment.</p>
                                <p>Because a Vice relies on its network to gather data about the Host’s body, larval Vices cannot perform QAC checks. Instead, larval Vices wait for elevated hormone levels to reach an extreme, though this objective threshold is relatively high, resulting in little to no initiated Branches during the larval stage.</p>
                                <p>The preliminary data gathered about the Host’s body includes a comprehensive view of hormone levels--not just the level of its preferred hormone--AV output, and traditional vital signs such as temperature, heart rate, respiration rate, and blood pressure. This data tells the Vice if the hormone increase is an anomaly or the direct result of a specific event and if it is safe to pursue initiation, in the event of a lower AV output.</p>
                                <p>After the Vice determines the Host’s body is in a state conducive to Branch initiation, they will then assess the environment. Using a stolon--a single, external track--Vices generate a log of the surrounding environment’s properties. The complexity and number of properties logged differ between classifications and maturity levels. Common properties include general location (indoor vs. outdoor), proximity to others, sound level, and smells. Properties logged by more meticulous Vices can include, but are not limited to, temperature and humidity, the amount of natural light, specific words or phrases based on sound waves, and even the presence of specific people.</p>
                                <p>After this second check, a Vice will only initiate a Branch if the environmental properties match at least three of those found at advent. This, of course, is relatively straightforward for sudden advents, but tend to be obfuscated and difficult to gauge for gradual advents. These properties are one facet of the Branch Policy, and tend to remain the same throughout the Vice’s life cycle.</p>
                                <p>After the QAC is passed, the Vice officially initiates the Branch. When a Vice performs a QAC and opts to initiate a Branch despite the presence of advent properties, this is known as a rogue Branch, further explored in <a href="#fringe">Fringe Branch Events</a>.</p>

                                    <h3>Initiation</h3>
                                </div>
                                <p>Initiation, though referred to as a phase, is more of a “toggle”, indicating the beginning of the Branch. The environmental and internal circumstances that result in the successful initiation of a Branch are a vital part of a Vice’s <a href="#policies">Branch Policy</a> and should be documented to more accurately predict or even avoid future Branches. These properties can also be used to try to “bait” a Vice into initiating a Branch, where <a href="#instigation">instigation</a> may be risky.</p>
                                <p>Branch initiation is marked by a physiological change to the Vice’s network. By default, the vitiumnexum (VN) that make up the tracks in a Vice’s network are tightly-packed and neutrally charged, but after initiation, the tracks’ structural integrity is compromised as the VN becomes positively-charged and the molecules begin repelling one another.</p>
                                <p>Some Hosts are able to “feel” their own Branch initiation, most commonly experienced as a fluttering, irregular heartbeat or a sudden, inexplicable ice pick headache, both likely due to the change in the electromagnetic field within them. While not as common, other physiological indicators of initiation have been reported, such as goosebumbs, twitching muscles, inexplicable nausea, sudden dizziness, and lockjaw.</p>
                            </div>
                            <div class="timeline__stop">

                                    <h3>Staging</h3>
                                </div>
                                <p>A Branch officially moves into staging once the VG—previously contained in the tracks—leech out into the Host’s bloodstream, resulting in a sedative effect. Hosts also report brain fog, depression, and anxiety during this time. Roughly 15% of Hosts have the opposite reaction to the increased VG and instead become erratic and volatile during staging. Regardless of this reaction, Hosts often feel like their actions are out of their control, like their body has been put on autopilot. While Hosts are aware of their surroundings during this time, they feel like they are in limbo as their body acts on its own.</p>
                                <p>As the VG level increases throughout the body, immune responses are more likely. Reactions can range from mildly irritating to excruciating. Itching, increased body temperature, sweating, and even anaphylaxis are all potential reactions, in addition to agitated blights and increased AV output. Additionally, the body releases stress hormones, which the Vice temporarily stores in its core to fuel its pending germination and core augmentation. Despite its best efforts, the Host’s immune system is often overwhelmed during this time and is unable to defend against the onslaught of VG.</p>
                                <p>In the beginnings of staging, the altered electromagnetic field that marked initiation fans outward from the Host, becoming the “staging radius”. A standard staging radius extends roughly 12 feet, but can be as short as six or as wide as eighteen. Those within the staging radius report disorienting vestibular disturbances, with symptoms such as tinnitus, nausea, imbalance, and vertigo. Many also feel a slight “tugging” at the soles of their feet, resulting in the trademark “magnetic pull” of staging.</p>
                                <p>During staging, if physical contact is made with the Host, the person will be added to the Branch queue, a liminal space where Adjuncts linger while the Branch is being fabricated. A potential Adjunct must make and maintain physical contact with the Host throughout staging in order to be included in production. If contact is lost during this phase, the Adjunct will be “dismissed” from the queue, but can easily be re-added as long as the Branch is still in staging. As the Branch approaches production, some particularly intelligent Vices will briefly send bursts of energy not unlike hypnic jerks in an attempt to break contact, though this tends to be energy-intensive and is only performed by desperate or mature Vices. Much like the Host, Adjuncts in the queue are aware of their surroundings, but feel like they are on autopilot.</p>
                                <p>Tertiary Adjuncts are added to the queue by the Vice extending external tracks to reach any people within the staging radius. This behavior is often observed in mature Vices with a highly established network that are aiming for increased energy consumption during dispersion, as observed in Theta Vices. This connection can be easily lost, however, if the tertiary Adjunct is able to break free from the trance, which is relatively simple due to the lack of physical contact. This action is typically performed shortly before the Branch moves into production, wherein the connection is solidified and slightly more difficult to breach.</p>
                                <p>On the whole, staging typically lasts anywhere from one to three minutes, depending on the intended complexity of the Branch, with instigated Branches often having shorter staging times.</p>
                                <h4>Suspension</h4>
                                <p>At any time during staging, a patch can be summoned to aid in suspending a Branch, where the patch is more abstract in its form, with fuzzy edges and warping shapes due to its composition of AV. Suspension criterion differs between Vices, but is generally achieved by threatening the Vice core with bursts of AV, either from a patch or an AV Shot, without making physical contact with the Host. Suspension should only be pursued as a last resort, as discussed below in <a href="#options">Branch Options</a>.</p>
                            </div>
                            <div class="timeline__stop">
                                <div class="heading-group">

                                    <h3>Production</h3>
                                </div>
                                <p>Production is the most complex of the phases and where the majority of the action occurs. A Branch is officially in production once staging is complete and the Host is immobilized and unresponsive to external stimuli. Many Hosts recall the sensation of falling as they are admitted to the Branch Arena, marking the start of production. Adjuncts, on the other hand, remain in the queue for their designated admission time and are always admitted to the Branch Arena after the Host.</p>
                                <p>Production occurs in two realms: corporeal and metaphysical. The metaphysical realm refers to the events that take place in the Branch Arena, a shared “battleground” of sorts where facsimiles of the Host and Adjuncts—called “extensions”—duel against the Vice’s exhibition, a grotesque visage that surrounds and protects the Vice’s core. The corporeal realm refers to the physical state of affairs outside of the Branch Arena, including core behavior and the physiological effects on the Host’s body, as well as any physical interactions between the Host and Adjuncts.</p>
                                <p>The metaphysical realm operates on a different timeline from the corporeal realm, where five minutes of corporeal time can span anywhere from 10 minutes to an hour of metaphysical time. While these realms are separate, what happens in the metaphysical realm often loosely mirrors the events of the corporeal realm, and vice versa, each being able to influence the other realm. This relationship is not a direct one-to-one, and researchers are still trying to fully understand the degree to which the events that take place in each realm directly impact the other. It is generally understood how the events of the corporeal realm affect the metaphysical realm, but the opposite still requires extensive research. The metaphysical realm, and by extension the Branch Arena, is particularly difficult to observe and document from a strictly objective standpoint due to its unique properties between Hosts. The intricacies of these realms are explored further below.</p>
                                <p>Branches are intended to be committed or rescinded during this phase, most commonly performed in the metaphysical realm, though some exceptions apply. Inaction while a Branch is in production can lead to a <a href="#">berserk</a> or <a href="#">comatose</a> Host, which often makes committing or rescinding the Branch more difficult. This phase does not last for a determined amount of time, but if ignored, a Vice can achieve dispersion in less than 10 minutes of corporeal time, sometimes as quickly as five in extreme circumstances.</p>
                                <h4 id="corporeal">The Corporeal Realm</h4>
                                <p>Physically, Hosts have described this realm as almost dreamlike in quality, some even going so far as to liken it to drug-induced dissociative episodes. The overwhelming rush of VG has a sedative effect on the Host to deter interference with the core’s expansion. The Host is also “disconnected” from their body in the sense that they do not react to stimuli once the Branch is in production. The only way to break a Host from this trance is to commit or rescind the Vice.</p>
                                <p>Because the Host has essentially been sedated, behavioral symptoms are generally mild, but the physiological reactions seen in staging often persist. Hosts are technically able to feel pain during this time, but are not typically able to recall in explicit detail. Most events that transpire in the corporeal realm are recalled with muddy, vague details, not unlike trying to remember a dream after waking up.</p>
                                <p>Branches are not addressed in the corporeal realm, except in the extreme circumstances of manual rescission, an experimental rescission method that should only be performed as a last resort. Learn more about the different types of rescission under <a href="#options">Branch Options</a> below or as a <a href="#">service</a> provided by a Vice Management Specialist.</p>
                                <h4 id="metaphysical">The Metaphysical Realm (Branch Arena)</h4>
                                <p>Production officially begins once the Host is admitted to the Branch Arena, where the majority of action takes place. Adjuncts are admitted to the Branch Arena in the same order they were added to the queue during staging, with a 1:8 ratio for wait times. That is to say, if an Adjunct joined the queue 15 seconds into staging, they would be admitted roughly 2 minutes after the Host is admitted to the Branch Arena.</p>
                                <p>Everyone experiences this intangible realm differently, but many have likened being in the Branch Arena to lucid dreaming or astral projecting. Those who have spent less time in this realm have difficulty orienting themselves, though it comes more naturally over time. While research is still being conducted, this environment is believed to be the “side effect” of having the body being overrun with VG, and the shared contact is what enables the “shared hallucination” to occur between those present for the Branch. The mechanics of the metaphysical realm continue to be a hot research topic and are continually documented by the <a href="#">Observation team</a> as well as agents present in the arena.</p>
                                <p>This arena typically mimics the properties of the environment around the Host during advent. Arenas vary greatly in size, ranging anywhere from the size of a standard room to multi-acre fields. The smaller arenas of Vices with a sudden advent tend to have sharper details with a focus on objects, while the larger arenas of Vices with a gradual advent tend to be less detailed, with an emphasis on feelings, sensations, and disorienting architecture. Mature Vices with high threat levels can sometimes accomplish both, creating complex, escheresque environments with strikingly realistic details.</p>
                                <p>The five senses can and are often aroused within the arena, with Hosts and Adjuncts able to recall sounds, smells, and even tastes after a Branch has passed. This environment typically does not change throughout a Vice’s life cycle, but it may increase in complexity and expand to include a larger area or a different room, for example. Some intelligent Vices are capable of completely changing this environment between Branches, but this is incredibly rare overall.</p>
                                <p>Vices with a higher threat level often use psychological tactics to further dissuade action by projecting visages of people from the Host’s life. These projections typically pull from the Host’s memories and are used to discourage or distract the Host from acting promptly, triggering strong emotions or psychologically trapping them in past scenarios. When observed closely, these projections can be somewhat unsettling. They are often likened to images generated by young neural nets, resulting in uncanny reconstructions that feel off in a way that can excite our fight or flight response. These projections can and will react to speech or touch, but typically in incoherent or uncharacteristic ways. These projections cannot physically harm the extensions of the Host or Adjuncts.</p>
                                <p>Another facet of a Vice’s Branch Policy is its exhibition, a visage only seen and deployed in the Branch Arena. Its purpose is to both intimidate the Host and protect its core from attacks, which the visage is constructed around.In the Branch Arena, exhibitions can be as small as a house cat or span as much as 5 times taller than the average human. A Vice’s exhibition tends to remain largely unchanged throughout its life cycle, though a select few have been observed to alter their characteristics between Branches. Some suspect that core placement in the body can mimic core placement in the Vice’s exhibition; though, this has not been substantiated and is a massive generalization, as many exhibitions do not share our anatomy.</p>
                                <p>Exhibitions most commonly mimic animals—spanning the breadth of the animal kingdom from mammals to reptiles to insects and everything in between—often preying on our innate fear of predators or even personal phobias. Less commonly, exhibitions extend beyond our zoological roster and present as amalgamations of multiple animals and can even mimic those found in science fiction and horror films. A Vice’s threat level typically informs the complexity and novelty of its exhibition. Learn more about exhibitions below in <a href="#exhibitions">Exploring Exhibitions</a>.</p>
                                <p>Within the Branch Arena, patches can be summoned to fight the exhibition and threaten or destroy the Vice core. The form that patches take in production are more concrete and stable than the patches summoned during staging. If a patch is summoned during staging and the wielder is brought in as an Adjunct, the patch will already be active once they enter the Branch Arena. Learn more about using patches in the Branch Arena in <a href="#options">Branch Options</a> below, or learn about the process of establishing one in <a href="./bodies.html#av">AV and Patches</a>.</p>
                                <p>Any and all objects present in the Branch Arena can have an effect on and be used to defend or fight against the Vice's exhibition, though patches will always be the most efficient due to their molecular structure. This includes both the Host and Adjunct's extensions, meaning hand-to-hand combat can be an effective means of action if a patch cannot be summoned. This also means that these extensions can be affected and damaged by the Vice's exhibition.</p>
                                <p>If a Host or Adjunct's extension is damaged by the exhibition in the metaphysical realm, similar injuries are incurred in the corporeal realm, though they will be significantly less severe. For example, if a Host's bone is broken in the metaphysical realm, it can present as joint stiffness in the corporeal realm, even lasting after the Branch has been addressed. The gap in severity varies from person to person, though Hosts tend to incur more serious injuries in the corporeal realm compared to Adjuncts.</p>
                                <p>If an Adjunct's extension is destroyed in the Branch Arena, they are immediately ejected. Due to the severity of the injuries incurred in the Branch Arena, they will quickly begin to see the effects of the Branch on their body through ailments such as deep bruises, lacerations, minor bone fractures or even acute illness. Vices do not typically destroy the Host's extension and tend to keep them trapped in the Branch Arena so as to not risk interference as they continue germination or augmentation.</p>

                    <h2 id="policies">Branch Policies</h2>
                    <p>Every Vice has a set of relatively static data that influences Branches, known collectively as the Branch Policy. This data is typically established at advent and tends to remain generally the same throughout a Vice’s life cycle. Some classifications--specifically <a href="./classes/delta.html">Delta</a> and <a href="./classes/epsilon.html">Epsilon</a> Vices--are able to intentionally change these properties as a defense mechanism or to catch the Host by surprise. Each subset of data is further outlined below.</p>
                    <p>Contrary to popular belief, the time between Branches is not part of a Vice’s Branch Policy, and is instead influenced by the method used in addressing the Branch (suspension vs commit) and how much the core was damaged. Learn more about this relationship in <a href="#options">Branch Options</a> below.</p>
                    <h3>Environmental Branch Trigger(s)</h3>
                    <p>This set of information is established at advent and is referenced during the Quality Assurance Check (QAC) before a Branch. If the current properties of the Host’s environment match at minimum three of the properties found at advent, the Vice will proceed with Branch initiation. Examples of these properties most commonly include sounds and smells, but can even include temperature and the amount of natural light. Learn more about QACs in <a href="#qac">Phase 0: Quality Assurance Check</a>.</p>
                    <h3>Branch Arena Blueprint</h3>
                    <p>As discussed in <a href="#metaphysical">The Metaphysical Realm</a>, the layout of the Branch Arena typically pulls inspiration from the environment around the Host at advent.  In the case of a gradual advent, the blueprint often begins as a simple arena, but evolves over time and becomes more complex, some even containing multiple stages or rooms the Vice can switch between during production.</p>
                    <p>Small details of the Branch Arena are less detailed or difficult to parse when observed directly, much like the details of a dream. The overall blueprint of the Branch Arena stays roughly the same throughout a Vice’s life cycle, but can and often does increase in complexity as the Vice matures, especially for those with a gradual advent or a higher threat level.</p>
                    <p>Some classifications are capable of constructing novel blueprints to better suit their exhibition, but this is only observed in extremely intelligent Vices with a higher threat level&mdash;such as <a href="./classes/omega.html">Omega</a> and <a href="./classes/epsilon.html">Epsilon</a> Vices.</p>
                    <h3>Exhibition Presentation</h3>
                    <p>Only present in the Branch Arena, a Vice's exhibition shields the vulnerable core from the Host, Adjuncts and their patches. Exhibitions typically take the form of predatory animals—though the possibilities are endless. Some exhibitions are comprised of the properties present at advent, typically textures, smells or sounds and can even draw from the innate fears of the Host. The characteristics of the exhibition are also influenced by its attack strategy, and vice versa, an example being how defensive exhibitions typically have a thicker skin or protective outer shell.</p>
                    <p>Exhibitions are incredibly unique and vary greatly between Hosts, but tend to stay roughly the same throughout a Vice’s life cycle. As with the Branch Arena blueprint, a Vice’s exhibition can increase in complexity as the Vice matures. Exhibitions can be classified by size, and tend to stay in the same size grouping, even as complexity increases. Learn more about exhibitions in <a href="#exhibitions">Exploring Exhibitions</a> below.</p>
                    <h3>Exhibition Attack Strategy</h3>
                    <p>This data set is relatively broad and refers to a Vice’s M.O., that is, how the Vice interacts with the Host and Adjuncts within the Branch Arena. This attack strategy informs how the exhibition is classified, as offensive, defensive, hasty, or balanced. A Vice’s attack strategy is not directly tied to its classification, thought most classes tend to see higher concentrations of specific exhibition attack strategies. For example, <a href="./classes.theta.html">Theta Vices</a> Vices typically have hasty exhibitions while <a href="./classes/zeta.html">Zeta Vices</a> almost exclusively have defensive exhibitions.</p>
                    <p>Attack strategy also refers to the literal plan of attack once the Branch moves into production. This data is extremely broad, as every exhibition is different, but includes preferences such as which extensions the exhibition targets and how the exhibition interacts with the Branch Arena--if it uses objects or hides behind them. These preferences also include the core reactivity or how much damage the core allows before terminating a Branch. Learn more about exhibitions in <a href="#exhibitions">Exploring Exhibitions</a> below.</p>
                    <h3>Core Priorities</h3>
                    <p>Once a Branch is initiated, the Vice core will pursue two options, germination or core augmentation. Classifications tend to be a good indicator of which option a Vice will prefer, though it is not a hard and fast rule. Vices can also pursue both simultaneously, though overall progress in each will be sacrificed.</p>
                    <p>Germination is the process of expanding the network, a series of VN-packed tracks that extend throughout the Host’s body. Prioritizing this process lays the groundwork for a more efficient and successful dispersion, as a well-established network is key to acquiring as much fuel as possible. Core augmentation is the process of physically expanding the core along these established tracks. Growth otherwise occurs at a near-imperceptible rate so as to not trip the Host’s immune system. Core augmentation is necessary to enact dispersion, so periods of unrestrained growth contribute immensely to that goal.</p>
                    <p>Though both germination and core augmentation are often prioritized, a Vice will always have a preference, and this preference can influence Branch frequency, feeding and storage habits, and the expected behaviors to look out for prior to the Vice pursuing dispersion. Learn more about these priorities and what they imply for each classification in <a href="./classes/index.html">Classifying Vices</a>.</p>
                    <h2 id="options">Branch Options</h2>
                    <p>Hosts and Adjuncts have three options when encountering a Branch, depending on the Branch phase. During staging, an Adjunct can suspend the Branch, and during production the Host or an Adjunct can commit or rescind the Branch.</p>
                    <h3 id="suspend" class="has-label">Suspend <span class="label">Staging</span></h3>
                    <p>Suspending a Branch requires an Adjunct to threaten the Vice’s core during staging without making physical contact. What constitutes as “threatening” varies greatly between Vices, though it usually involves overwhelming the core with a burst of AV while the Branch is being staged. While Hosts, in theory, can suspend their own Branch using an AV Shot, as discussed below, staging typically sedates and compromises the Host, making it difficult to perform self-suspension.</p>
                    <p>Suspension is most commonly achieved in one of two ways, either by using a patch or an AVShot to facilitate this “burst” of AV. A bludgeoning patch is less “damaging” to the Host’s physical body and tends to threaten the Vice core in a less invasive manner due to the burst of AV released from contact. Piercing and slashing patches are more concentrated and need to cut quite deep in order to threaten the core, which also runs the risk of triggering fusion if the patch comes too close. While AV Shots are not widely available, CVRS agents can administer them en lieu of using a patch, which is the recommended method of suspension as it avoids inflicting harm on the Host. The rush of AV works to threaten the Vice much in the same way a burst of AV from a patch would.</p>
                    <p>A Vice will also terminate the Branch if the Host loses consciousness during staging, either from natural causes or as the direct result of the damage incurred from a patch. It is not uncommon for bludgeoning patches to result in a loss of consciousness before the Vice is officially threatened, as the bursts of AV combined with repeated blunt trauma are typically enough to render the Host unconscious. For this reason, we recommend using an AV Shot rather than attempting suspension with a patch.</p>
                    <p>Suspending, compared to committing, is often regarded as a reckless approach with many downsides; this is because suspension:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>exposes the Host to unnecessary bodily harm</strong><br/>Regardless of the suspension approach, some degree of harm must be imparted on the Host’s body in order to be successful. Even if an AV Shot is used en lieu of a patch, the Host’s body still has to undergo the side effects of flooding the body with AV, as explored in AV Enhancement.</li>
                        <li><strong>reduces the time until the next potential Branch</strong><br/>For example, if the typical down time between committed Branches is 6 weeks, but a Host suspends the Branch instead, another Branch could be initiated in less than two weeks.</li>
                        <li><strong>can lead to rogue Branches or deviations in Branch Policy</strong><br/>Vices tend to react poorly to surprises and interference, also observed in their negative reactions to instigated Branches. In an effort to regain control, a Vice is likely to initiate rogue Branches to catch the Host off guard.</li>
                        <li><strong>aids in the reproduction of Vices</strong><br/>During staging, the VG coursing throughout the Host’s body tend to seep out of the pores in the skin and spread across the epidermis in a thin layer. In the event of an amateur suspension, using a patch to perform suspension often works to actually spread VG, compared to attacking the core in the confines of the Branch Arena. This is particularly due to the fact that bludgeoning patches are the most common patch type when performing suspension outside of CVRS.</li>
                        <li><strong>misses out on the opportunity to reduce overall core progress</strong><br/>Committing a Branch reliably nullifies not only the progress made in germination or augmentation during the Branch, but also reduces the overall size of the core due to the damage inflicted. For example, during a Branch, a 30mm core may expand 5mm and create 3 new tracks in their network. Committing the Branch nullifies the newly-created tracks and can reduce the size of the core to 28mm. Conversely, suspending a Branch does no more than pause the germination or augmentation.</li>
                        <li><strong>degrades patches quickly</strong><br/>Using a patch outside of the Branch Arena can result in an unstable form, reducing its efficacy. Patches are intended to be wielded in the Branch Arena, where they receive much less wear and tear from use, making it easier to maintain the patch’s form between Branches. The damage received during staging is typically so severe that it can be difficult to repair in full before the next Branch without AV enhancement therapy.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Due to these downsides, suspension should only be performed as a last resort after it is determined that more help or time to prepare is needed.</p>
                    <h3 id="commit" class="has-label">Commit <span class="label">Production</span></h3>
                    <p>The circumstances around commits are fairly lenient, so long as the core is damaged during the production phase of an active Branch. Commits can be performed by an Adjunct or the Host themself in the metaphysical realm using any means necessary, including patches, their bare hands, or even objects found in the Branch Arena.</p>
                    <p>The degree of damage required to prompt Branch termination varies between classifications and even between individual Vices. Some are more quick to concede after minimal damage, while others require more substantial damage. Vices with a low threat level tend to be more reactive, while Vices with a higher threat level tend to be more intentional. This characteristic is part of the Vice’s Branch Policy.</p>
                    <p>In the metaphysical realm, Vices house their core in their exhibition, which acts as a dense barrier between its core and the Host, Adjuncts and patches. Exhibitions react to and can be damaged by patches, where contact between the two typically results in a burst of energy that depletes the level of VG in the exhibition and the AV in the patch. Repeated manual combat can also damage an exhibition without losing AV, though it is less efficient.</p>
                    <p>Because both the exhibition and patches lose density and become less effective over time, technique and discernment are encouraged so as to not render patches useless during a Branch. Patches can be restored, though this is a timely process and not something many can afford to do during Branches. Despite repeated exposure, manual combat does not lose its effectiveness over time and is considered a suitable backup in the event of ineffective patches.</p>
                    <p>When a Branch is successfully committed, due to the damage to the core, a Vice retracts any newly sprouted germination tracks and diverts the energy to focus on repairing the core. It is difficult to pose a generalized statement about the relationship between core damage and the time between Branches, as this relationship is typically unique to individual Vices. While not part of the Branch Policy, with dedicated observation, this relationship can be parsed and used to prepare for future Branches. Though, as a general rule, the time between committed Branches will always be longer than suspended Branches.</p>
                    <p>Committing a Branch is always recommended over suspending a Branch for the following reasons:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Committing a Branch provides the opportunity to inflict enough damage to the core for a Vice to lose progress. Suspending a Branch will never result in lost progress, as it merely halts its progress. Some more aggressive and efficient commits have been shown to reduce the size of a Vice core by nearly half.</li>
                        <li>This lost progress buys a Host more time between Branches as it focuses on repair, compared to suspension.</li>
                        <li>Branches provide the Host and any primary or secondary Adjuncts present with valuable information that can inform rescission methodology, whereas suspending a Branch before it begins doesn’t allow the Host to gather any new information</li>
                        <li>Repeated summoning within the Branch Arena bolsters and solidifies patch markup, allowing for minor enhancements between Branches</li>
                        <li>Allowing Adjuncts to regularly join and commit Branches can result in a primary Adjunct with a stronger tie to the Branch Arena. Primary Adjuncts are often integral to a successful rescission.</li>
                    </ol>
                    <h3 id="rescind" class="has-label">Rescind <span class="label">Production</span></h3>
                    <p>Rescinding a Branch is the act of destroying a Vice core, ultimately killing the Vice. Rescission is a difficult process that requires strength, discernment, and precision. Weaker and more imprecise blows will merely damage the core and trigger the Vice to terminate the Branch before the core can be fully destroyed. Terminating a Branch requires energy, so if the core is damaged enough before it can react, it will be unable to terminate the Branch and the core can be completely destroyed.</p>
                    <p>The Host and Adjuncts will need to utilize the observations and information gathered in previous Branches to prepare the most efficient and extensive plan of attack, known as the rescission methodology. Classifying Vices briefly outlines tactics for rescinding the various classifications.</p>
                    <p>Having a diverse team of support for rescission is highly recommended, as the varying patches and vantage points offer a multitude of benefits. While the Host’s patch is typically crafted as a bespoke weapon to combat their Vice’s exhibition, sometimes a multi-tool approach needs to be implemented for more complex or defensive exhibitions. Solutions Architects are CVRS agents trained to detect weaknesses in a Vice’s exhibition, and can be a valuable addition to a Host’s treatment team.</p>
                    <p>If you have been admitted for care with a CVRS team, there are different rescission approaches available depending on the severity of your Vice classification: standard rescission, exposure rescission, and manual rescission. These approaches are outlined in Rescission under Services, Treatment & Support, but in short:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Standard rescission is the act of destroying the Vice core within the Branch Arena, most commonly utilizing patches. This is the gold standard of rescission.</li>
                        <li>Exposure rescission entails gradually eating away at the Vice core using a series of AV Shots. This method is often employed in conjunction with standard rescission.</li>
                        <li>Manual rescission is performed by manually separating the core from the Host’s body, typically with the use of surgical tools. This method is experimental and highly risky and should only be pursued as a last resort.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h2 id="exhibitions">Exploring Exhibitions</h2>
                    <p>Within the Branch Arena, a Host and their Adjunct(s) are pitted against the Vice’s exhibition, a creature-like visage that shields the Vice’s core from attacks. When a Branch is in production, the most surefire way to address the Branch is to either damage or destroy the Vice’s core, which entails sparring with the Vice’s exhibition.</p>
                    <p>The exhibition houses the Vice’s core, which is stored in the same place for every Branch. Hosts and Adjuncts can use hand-to-hand combat to damage the core, but, if established, their patches are much more efficient. Patches are created to be direct counters to a Host’s exhibition; for example, if a Vice’s exhibition has a thick hide, a piercing patch is likely to be established. Learn more about patches in <a href="./bodies.html#av">AV and Patches</a>.</p>
                    <p>Exhibitions are capable of resembling anything the mind can conjure, though they typically resemble predatory animals or grotesque amalgamations akin to monsters in horror movies. Exhibitions can be as small as an armadillo or tower over a house. Size and complexity do have limits, however, typically capped by the Vice’s energy reserves. Some classifications prioritize complex and grand exhibitions, while others prefer to focus more on their plan of attack.</p>
                    <p>The characteristics of an exhibition are largely determined at advent, either pulling from internalized fears or from the Host’s experience during advent, both of which can influence the exhibition’s textures, body composition, and even smell. Exhibitions do not have to be bipedal, nor do they even need to have legs at all. Exhibitions can have wings, tails, spines, multiple sets of eyes, multiple heads, and multiple sets of limbs. Exhibitions can mimic insects, aquatic animals, birds, and even extinct species or creatures from pop culture like kaiju or cryptids. The possibilities truly are endless.</p>
                    <p>Most exhibitions remain largely the same throughout a Vice’s life cycle, only increasing in complexity as it matures. Because of this, a Vice’s exhibition is part of its <a href="#policies">Branch Policy</a>. Typically, Vices do not make drastic changes to their exhibitions between Branches, as it is an energy-intensive task to perform; though, some classifications have perfected the ability and are known for doing so, namely <a href="./classes/delta.html">Delta</a> and <a href="./classes/epsilon.html">Epsilon</a> Vices. Learn more about the differing exhibition properties between classifications in <a href="./classes/index.html">Classifying Vices</a>.</p>
                    <p>Exhibitions also influence blights, and characteristics observed in the Branch Arena can be seen mirrored in the Host, manifested through blights. For example, if a Vice’s exhibition has horns, is covered in scales, and can spit acid, the Host is likely to have similar horns, patches of scales, and acidic saliva. Learn more about blights in <a href="./bodies.html#blights">What are Blights?</a>.</p>
                    <h3>Exhibition Properties</h3>
                    <p>Branch Analysts have devised broad categories for documentation and preparatory purposes. These categories largely influence treatment plans and can help agents and Hosts prepare plans of attack.</p>
                    <p>While size is not necessarily indicative of threat level, larger exhibitions often require a larger treatment team. Size in this instance refers to height, not weight. Exhibition sizes are categorized using the following prefixes:</p>
                    <dl class="desc-list desc-list--feature four-col">
                        <div class="desc-list__item">

This classification informs the types of patches needed for efficiently addressing the Branch, and helps agents better formulate their plans of attack. The core purpose of exhibitions is to trap a Host and their Adjuncts in the Branch Arena as the core pursues germination and augmentation. The method in which they are able to do so is indicated by these categories and is a facet of the Vice’s <a href="#policies">Branch Policy</a>.</p>

Some offensive exhibitions put resources in speed at the expense of their attack, while still predominantly prioritizing attack.

                    <h2 id="adjuncts">The Role of Adjuncts</h2>
                    <p>While it is possible to address Branches alone, many Hosts benefit from the support that Adjuncts can offer. Adjuncts can increase the success rates, typically by strengthening defenses, increasing firepower, or even serving as a distraction. Depending on their relationship with the Host, Adjuncts can be classified as primary, secondary, or tertiary, abbreviated as p!Adjunct, s!Adjunct, and t!Adjunct, respectively. Primary and secondary Adjuncts are queued during staging via physical touch, while tertiary Adjuncts are brought in during staging by a Vice extending its tracks. Adjuncts are admitted to production after the Host has entered the Branch Arena. Primary and secondary Adjuncts must maintain contact with the Host during both staging and production. Due to their lack of contact, tertiary Adjuncts are often dismissed from Branches.</p>
                    <dl class="desc-list">
                        <dt>Tertiary Adjunct <small>(t!Adjunct)</small></dt>
                        <dd>
                            <p>Tertiary Adjuncts are a relatively rare phenomenon, and are often unassuming strangers brought into Branches by a Vice to throw off the Host and increase energy consumption if a Vice is confident in reaching dispersion. These Adjuncts are typically only associated with specific Vice classifications, such as Theta Vices, or intelligent, calculating Vices, as the act of queuing and maintaining “contact” with tertiary Adjuncts is quite energy-intensive.</p>
                            <p>The Vice extends its tracks to latch on to those within the staging radius, though the connection is weak during staging and can be easily lost, so Vices tend to employ this tactic  right before production. After these Adjuncts are admitted to the Branch Arena, their connection is somewhat solidified, though still relatively easy to break free from, which often occurs before the Branch is addressed. Tertiary Adjuncts cannot summon patches in the Branch Arena due to this weak connection. A Vice is also capable of easily expelling a tertiary Adjunct if they become too much of a threat, known as dismissal.</p>
                        </dd>
                        <dt>Secondary Adjunct <small>(s!Adjunct)</small></dt>
                        <dd>Secondary Adjuncts are the most common, spanning anywhere from someone who is attending a Host's Branch for the first time to people who have been admitted to more than five. These Adjuncts are intentionally brought into Branches via physical touch while the  Branch is being staged. Secondary Adjuncts are capable of summoning  patches and are less likely to be dismissed, though it is still possible for less experienced Adjuncts. The more often a secondary Adjunct is brought in, the stronger the connection becomes. Though the number  varies between Hosts, after a secondary Adjunct has made several contributions to the success of Branches, be it analyzing the Branch Policy or facilitating commits, they are reclassified as a primary Adjunct. The number of Branches an Adjunct has been admitted to does not determine their classification; rather, their connection to the Host and situational awareness within the Branch Arena sets these Adjuncts apart.</dd>
                        <dt>Primary Adjunct <small>(p!Adjunct)</small></dt>
                        <dd>
                            <p>Primary Adjuncts have regularly aided in committing Branches for a Host and have a firm grasp of its Branch Policy. Because of this, primary Adjuncts are less common, but they are invaluable during Branches and rescission, especially. Many Vice Management Specialists quickly become a primary Adjunct for their patients after thorough analysis of their Branch Policy.</p>
                            <p>Due to their stronger connection, Primary Adjuncts are more difficult to dismiss, have a boost to their patch's efficacy, and have a higher success rate when forcing entry with a Bypass. Trust and confidence are integral in setting primary Adjuncts apart and play a large role in bolstering their connection to the Host during Branches. Because of this bond, primary Adjuncts are often able to perform fringe actions with the Host, such as merging patches, forcing entry, and even summoning reformed Vices more easily.</p>
                        </dd>
                        <dt>Pseudo Adjunct</dt>
                        <dd>
                            <p>While not common in everyday Branches, CVRS utilizes pseudo Adjuncts to observe Branches from a distance and document Vice behavior and Branch properties. Solutions Architects in  particular are brought in to detect weaknesses in a Vice's exhibition and pick up on patterns in early Branches, relaying this information to Vice Management Specialists and Branch Admins.</p>
                            <p>These agents are able to join Branches via proximity, using a modified Bypass with a lower electrical charge. This lower charge and their lack of contact with the Host result in a fairly weak but nearly undetectable presence in the Branch Arena. Most Vices do not notice a pseudo Adjunct's presence in the Branch Arena as their visage is often nearly transparent and amorphous. They also cannot have a direct impact on the Branch and are only able to communicate with the primary and secondary Adjuncts or external agents using a MobiComm.</p>

                    <h3 id="admission">The Admission Process</h3>
                    <p>The process of admitting primary and secondary Adjuncts to a Branch is not unlike a queue, where making contact with the Host is similar to reserving one's space in line. Adjuncts are admitted to the Branch Arena in the same order they were added to the queue during staging, with a 1:4 ratio for wait times. That is to say, if an Adjunct joined the queue 15 seconds into staging, they would be admitted roughly a minute after the Host is admitted to the Branch Arena.</p>
                    <p>If contact is interrupted, the Adjunct is sent to the back of the queue. If the Branch is somehow committed or rescinded while an Adjunct is in the queue, they are simply dismissed from the Branch. Adjuncts can be admitted simultaneously if contact was made at the same time, though primary Adjuncts tend to be admitted slightly sooner.</p>
                    <p>If an unpredictable Branch has been initiated and all Adjuncts do not have time to make contact with the Host, making contact with each other will suffice, so long as at least one Adjunct is in contact with the Host. Doing so creates an exponentially staggered queuing effect of bringing in Adjuncts, where Adjuncts that are two or three times removed from the Host can take up to an hour of in-Branch time to be brought in.</p>
                    <p>The key to Branch admission lies in making direct physical contact with the Host. At Branch initiation, the tightly-packed, neutrally-charged VN making up the tracks of a Vice’s network are electrified, temporarily exuding a positive charge. This compromises the track structure as the molecules repel each other and allows the VG previously stored in the tracks to leech into the Host’s bloodstream. If a person makes contact during this time, the human body acts as a conductor and expands the positively-charged electromagnetic field to include them. Breaking contact removes the flow of electricity and dismisses the Adjunct from the queue during staging, or from the Branch Arena during production.</p>
                    <h3 id="benefits">The Benefits of Employing Adjuncts</h3>
                    <p>The chart below shows how the number of secondary Adjuncts present in the Branch Arena increases the chances of success. The higher the threat level, the more Adjuncts required for higher rates of success. This increased rate of success extends to both committing and rescinding Branches.</p>

                    <h2 id="fringe">Fringe Branch Events</h2>
                    <p>While Branches of all kinds share the same three phases, there are some situations that can disrupt the expected flow.</p>
                    <h3>Rogue Branches</h3>
                    <p>When Vices deviate from an established Branch Policy and initiate Branches unexpectedly, these are referred to as "rogue" Branches, observed primarily in aggressive adolescent Vices and those with a medium or high threat level. Rogue Branches are typically initiated when a Vice is agitated, threatened or compromised. For example, AV Shots are generally considered threatening, as they inhibit growth and attack the Vice's core.</p>
                    <p>Hosts who progress to the berserk phase during an active Branch are at risk of experiencing rogue Branches after the current Branch has been addressed, especially if the Host is infected with an adolescent Vice. Mature and larval Vices are less likely to partake in this behavior, though it cannot be fully ruled out as a possibility.</p>
                    <p>Rogue Branches can also be influenced by drastic changes in the natural environment, such as fluctuating electromagnetic fields or gas leaks, though this is far less common. Dense concentrations of VG, either from a detached rumen or recent dispersion, also tend to excite or agitate Vices and result in rogue Branches, most commonly observed in those with a lower threat level.</p>
                    <p>Initiating rogue Branches is a particularly risky move for the Vice, as deviating from the established Branch Policy introduces unknown factors that can potentially skew the Branch in Host’s favor. Despite this risk, most Vices regardless of classification will attempt at least one rogue Branch in their life cycle, likely in the adolescent stage.</p>
                    <p>While most Hosts are sedated during staging, about 15% have the opposite reaction and become agitated and volatile. This percentage increases to 25% if the Host is experiencing a rogue Branch. Delta, Zeta, and Theta Vices almost never result in agitated Hosts during staging, regardless of the Branch type, though there have been some exceptions.</p>
                    <p>While this deviation from Branch Policy makes them particularly hard to prepare for, rogue Branches are not completely undetectable. If a Vice foregoes initiating a Branch during a situation that would otherwise align with its Branch Policy, it is likely reserving energy in preparation for its rogue attack. Rogue Branches also often follow periods of inexplicable or uncharacteristic fatigue, the result of its increased feeding and stockpiling for the upcoming rogue Branch. Not all periods of fatigue precede a rogue Branch, but any changes in mood, appetite, or energy levels should be reported to your Vice Management Specialist.</p>
                    <h3>Forcing Entry</h3>
                    <p>Adjuncts are able to force their way into an active Branch Arena by using a Bypass, a taser-like device issued to CVRS agents with higher experience levels. A Bypass produces an electric charge that is drawn to any stray or easily-accessible tracks in the Host's network. This temporarily provides a “bridge” of contact for the user to bypass the queuing process and enter the Branch Arena as if contact had been made during staging. Bypasses have an admission rate of roughly 72% and result in the immediate admission to the Branch Arena.</p>
                    <p>During staging, VN--which are neutrally-charged by default--become positively charged and begin repelling each other, allowing any stored VG to infiltrate the Host’s bloodstream. Bypasses take advantage of these now-vulnerable tracks by emitting a bolt of electricity the same intensity and charge, essentially serving the same purpose as a Vice’s extended stolon to admit tertiary Adjuncts. Learn more about the admission process in <a href="#adjuncts">The Role of Adjuncts</a>.</p>
                    <p>Side effects of using a Bypass include mild electrostatic shock, headaches, tinnitus, and lockjaw, and run the risk of inducing seizures if used too often or incorrectly. Weak and newly-established tracks account for the 28% of failed admissions, as the Bypass overloads the track and destroys the VN, releasing any VG or stored hormones into the Host’s bloodstream.</p>
                    <p>Upon entry, the agent's extension is weak, and contact must promptly be made with the Host in the corporeal realm in order to strengthen the connection and efficiently contribute to the Branch. If used too often or incorrectly, forcing oneself into a Branch can become painful for the agent, Host or any Adjuncts involved. If used outside of an active Branch, Bypasses have been known to instigate Branches, though sometimes this is done intentionally when standard instigation technology is unavailable. While forcing entry can be the difference between life or death, it must only be performed after careful consideration. Learn more about Bypasses in <a href="#">CVRS Technology</a>.</p>
                    <h3>Branch Instigation</h3>
                    <p>While Branches are typically initiated by the Vice as an attempt to expand their core or network, Branches can also be initiated by a Host or Adjuncts with the intent to commit or rescind the Vice. Branches are typically instigated by our Floor Managers in Urgent Care when performing <a href="../services/urgent-care/branch-remediation.html">Branch remediation</a>, which entails instigating a recently-suspended Branch so it can be properly committed. Vice Management Specialists in Primary Care also instigate Branches to collect observations throughout treatment or to catch a Vice off guard before pursuing <a href="../services/primary-care/rescission.html">rescission</a>.</p>
                    <p>As a CVRS patient, instigation will be performed in the observation chambers, where a concentrated, positively-charged electrostatic shock is deployed and directed toward any stray tracks in the Vice’s network. This triggers the VN to become positively-charged, resulting in an initiated Branch. Outside of the observation chambers, a <a href="../about/careers/gear.html#bypass">Bypass</a> can also be used to instigate a Branch in an emergency, and is often the instigation method of choice for Floor Managers.</p>
                    <p>Instigation is generally regarded as a risky endeavor and should only be performed by trained CVRS agents. Instigated Branches typically have a shorter staging time, so any desired Adjuncts should be nearby and prepared before pursuing instigation. Patches should also be summoned in advance so they are in hand once the Branch moves into production, as many exhibitions tend to be enraged at the beginning of production. While a Vice Management Specialist may instigate Branches often throughout a patient’s treatment, they are trained to do so with enough time in between so as to not prompt rogue Branches or permanent changes in the Branch Policy. This required “cool down” time between Branches varies between classifications and even between individual Vices.</p>

                    <p>The relationship between a Host and their Vice is generally considered parasitic, posing no benefit to the Host, but after performing reformation, a Host is able to utilize their Vice's strength in the Branch Arena. Reformation can only be achieved during an active Branch within the Branch Arena.</p>
                    <p>The act of reformation entails the Host's extension consuming the Vice core during production. For reasons still being researched, doing so prompts half of the AV stored in the Host’s body to alter its genetic makeup. This change results in a solvent-like fluid that envelopes the Vice core. As the Host’s extension feeds in Branch Arena, the majority of the core is dissolved, leaving behind only its genetic material suspended in the liquid.</p>
                    <p>This liquid is dispersed throughout the Host’s body and avoids setting off the immune system due to its predominant makeup of native AV. After a period of roughly 24 hours, the Host can reap the benefits of a successful reformation. This rest period gives the core time to circulate, creating a rudimentary “network” between small deposits across the Host’s body. This fluid remains in the system anywhere from as little as a year to as many as ten, depending on maturity and core size.</p>
                    <p>Hosts are not considered cleared if this process has occurred, as the majority of the Vice core is still present in the Host's body and even poses the threat of congealing and reestablishing its form, though this tends to be quite rare.

                    <h4>Factors of Success</h4>
                    <p>The act of reformation is rather difficult to see through to completion, as it requires a level of precision and skill in handling an exhibition. While all Vices can be reformed, adolescent Vices most commonly result in success due to their smaller, compact cores.</p>
                    <p>In order to properly reform a Vice, the Host must:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>incapacitate the exhibition without damaging the core</li>
                        <li>take a large enough bite out of the core to prevent it from terminating the Branch, and</li>
                        <li>consume the core in its entirety</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Vices terminate Branches when their core has been damaged, which makes incapacitating the exhibition so the core can be accessed the first hurdle. If the Vice core sustains enough damage in the incapacitation process, the Branch will be committed before reformation can occur. Larval Vices are not commonly reformed, as their fragility leads to prematurely-terminated Branches, and damage is often easily inflicted when incapacitating the exhibition.</p>
                    <p>If the exhibition is successfully incapacitated, the second hurdle is consuming enough of the core in a single bite that the Vice doesn't have enough energy left to terminate the Branch. Too small of a bite can simply damage the core and render the Branch committed. Though, if these two requirements are met, the Host can consume the core in its entirety.</p>
                    <p>In some cases, Hosts who intend to reform their Vice fail to do so properly and subject themselves to longer Branch times, actually allowing the Vice core to spread further than it would if the Branch had been properly committed or rescinded in a timely manner.</p>
                    <h4>Benefits</h4>
                    <p>After a successful reformation, the Host will now be able to initiate a transformation within another Host’s Branch Arena, much in the same way a patch is summoned. Because exhibitions exist solely in the Branch Arena, a reformed Vice cannot be summoned in the corporeal realm. This transformation is applied exclusively to the Host’s extension, altering it to mimic that of their reformed Vice's exhibition.</p>
                    <p>A complete transformation takes roughly five minutes of in-Branch time and can be paused at different stages. This transformation depletes a not-insignificant amount of the Vice core in the Host's body, so some Hosts intentionally pause the transformation during an intermediate stage to reap the benefits, but extend the amount of time these benefits are available to them.</p>
                    <p>This transformation, if brought to completion, results in a direct one-to-one copy of the Vice's exhibition, retaining its size, strength, speed, and defense. Because these features are merely enhancements to the Host’s extension and are predominantly comprised of AV, when physically interacting with an exhibition in the Branch Arena, manual combat can be just as effective as wielding a patch.</p>
                    <h4>Risks</h4>
                    <p>Reformation, while touting promising benefits, is an unreliable and imprecise process that poses the risk of being reversed without the Host's knowledge. Over time, the suspended genetic material can leech out of the mixture, and if enough of this material is freed simultaneously, it can congeal and begin the act of colonizing tissues. With enough time, this mass can become the Vice core once again, and threatens rogue Branches, often establishing a new and unfamiliar Branch Policy.</p>
                    <p>Reformation does not destroy the Vice’s network, though it does begin to deteriorate over time. If the core is able to re-congeal and attach itself to its prior network, it can pursue exponential growth and re-establish itself in to time at all.</p>
                    <p>Anecdotal evidence also reports that Hosts with reformed Vices can be uncharacteristically impulsive, aggressive and over-eager. While the act of reformation is regarded as a noble endeavor to help fellow Hosts, the process should be avoided until further research is conducted.</p>
