                        <p>In the same way the immune system might prompt a rash when battling a virus, blights are the body’s response to being infected with a Vice. Blights are influenced by the Vice’s exhibition and can be a valuable insight into changes in Vice activity.</p>

                    <p>Blights tend to mimic the Vice’s exhibition. For example, if a Vice's exhibition is covered in scales and exudes electricity, the Host is likely to have a couple patches of scales on their arms or face and lightly shock others when touching. If the Host progresses to a more severe status or the Vice is more mature, the Host might have their entire upper body covered in scales and have uncontrollable bouts of electric pulses.</p>
                    <p>Blights themselves are extensions of our body, typically triggered by dense concentrations of tracks in a Vice’s network. For this reason, complex, full-body blights are typically only observed in adolescent and mature Vices. Blights are not unique to older Vices, however, as expulsion blights are often observed during the larval stage.</p>
                    <h2>Acute vs. Chronic</h2>
                    <p>When discussing the impact of blights, it is important to also include the duration of the condition, as acute and chronic blights signal different Vice behavior to a Blight Specialist or Vice Management Specialist. Acute blights are sudden, drastic changes in size, number or surface area, including the onset of new blights. Chronic blights tend to be less severe, and refer to those that have remained visible for over 6 months, despite fluctuations in Vice activity. Acute blights indicate a sudden change in Vice behavior, such as Branch initiation or a reroute in resources, while chronic blights suggest a mature Vice has a well-established network.</p>
                    <h2>Types of Blights</h2>
                    <p>Blights can be split into four categories: expulsion, drape, extrusion, and pseudo. These categories give insight to blight behavior and can help Vice Management Specialists and Blight Specialists determine treatment.</p>
                    <h3>Expulsion Blights</h3>
                    <p>As the name suggests, expulsion blights begin in the body, but are ultimately expelled. These blights originate around the Vice core and exit the Host through the mouth, nose, ears, or pores. Most Hosts only have one expulsion blight at a time, which are often the first blight observed, as they are the only type of blight visible during the larval stage.</p>
                    <p>Because of their proximity to the Vice core, expulsion blights are highly reactive and tend to exhibit the most drastic change in volume in response to initiated Branches and core augmentation. Expulsion blights that mimic dangerous or harmful substances do not harm the Host, but can harm others on contact.</p>
                    <p>Examples of expulsion blights include smoke, static, and acid. Not all Hosts have expulsion blights, as they are dependent on the Vice’s exhibition. The less complex exhibitions of Vices with lower threat levels typically do not have characteristics that easily translate into expulsion blights.</p>
                    <h3>Drape Blights</h3>
                    <p>Drape blights lay close to the skin, rarely straying far from the Host’s body. These blights begin, and often stay, in localized patches across the skin and are sometimes considered the “heat map” of the Vice’s network. Collections of tracks found in junctions like shoulders and knees tend to contain dense concentrations of VG, triggering the production of these drape blights. In severe cases, they have been known to cover a Host’s entire body.</p>
                    <p>When agitated, drape blights are itchy, prompting many to pick at these patches. These blights can be removed from the skin, but often leave behind welts and lesions that can easily become infected if not properly cared for.</p>
                    <p>Examples most commonly include fur, scales, and feathers; though, some Hosts have noted unconventional presentation of these features, such as velvety scales or leathery patches lined with fur. Drape blights are more often observed in Vices with a higher threat level, likely due to the Vice’s established network.</p>
                    <h3>Extrusion Blights</h3>
                    <p>Extrusion blights are unnatural extensions of a Host’s body, typically originating and extruding from existing bone or deep within tissues. Extrusion blights from bone are stationery, while those that originate from tissues are able to be manipulated and articulated. These are the most commonly observed blights and have been known to present in many different ways, Hosts often being inflicted with multiple extrusion blights at a time.</p>
                    <p>The larger and further away from the body an extrusion blight is, the more sensitive or painful the base becomes due to strain. Extrusion blights are often heavy, dense, and uncomfortable, and larger blights often drive Hosts to seek treatment. Examples of smaller extrusion blights are fangs, blunt horns, and claws, while larger, more painful extrusion blights can be tails, long horns, wings, or spikes.</p>
                    <p>Many Vice Management Specialists and Blight Specialists measure the growth of these blights as a quick, non-invasive indicator of the Vice’s progress, as larger, more prominent extrusion blights directly correlate with increased core size. Because of this, comatose Hosts are typically overwhelmed by their extrusion blights, resulting in a deep-seated pain that resonates throughout the body. Chronic blights are most commonly extrusion blights.</p>
                    <h3>Pseudo Blights</h3>
                    <p>Pseudo blights are lingering blights that remain even after a Vice has been rescinded. These blights are often the result of more mature Vices that put a strain on the Host’s immune system and have left traces of its network behind; though, they can also be the result of a reformed Vice due to the VG and fragments of the Vice’s core are scattered throughout the Host’s body.</p>
                    <p>While pseudo blights can be any of the types listed above, drape blights tend to be the most common, as the denser collections of tracks found in the shoulders and knees when the network is active are the fragments most commonly left behind after rescission. These blights are typically more brittle and only manifest in scattered patches, rather than dense swaths of scales and feathers. These blights can easily be removed from the skin and are less likely to leave lesions when doing so.</p>
                    <p>After the Host has been cleared, the immune system and hormone levels can take roughly a month to equalize as it works to address any remaining traces of the Vice. Liminal Hosts are likely to deal with blights for the duration of their reformed Vice’s lifespan, which lasts typically no more than a year.</p>
                    <h2>Treating Blights</h2>
                    <p>Excessive blights can be treated with Suppressants, often administered by a Vice Management Specialist or Blight Specialist. Though, it is important to keep in mind that the manifestation of blights is a way in which our bodies communicate with us, and excessive blights are often indicative of an underlying issue. Suppressants should only be administered as a means of providing relief and not as a form of treatment. Learn more about Suppressants in <a href="../../services/primary-care/blight-management.html">Blight Management</a>.</p>
                    <p>Cleared and liminal Hosts may pursue additional treatment for their psuedo blights, typically from a Blight Specialist. In the case of liminal Hosts, a Blight Specialist will likely prescribe a single dose of Suppressants to provide relief for lingering blights without impacting the remaining core; whereas, cleared Hosts can benefit from AV Shots and AV enhancement therapies to break up any remaining network fragments. Learn more about these options in <a href="../../services/primary-care/blight-management.html">Blight Management</a>.</p>
