                        <p>As Vices have evolved, so, too, have our bodies. Our bodies learned to produce and release a counter-molecule called antivitumglomerorum (AV) in direct response to the growing complexity of Vices.</p>

                    <p>AV is stored and distributed in varying ways between Hosts. Depending on the location of the Vice core, various organs have adapted to produce AV, such as the adrenal glands, hypothalamus, and liver. AV is typically deployed in tandem with the hormones released as a stress response. The AV released alongside hormones attack the thin, wispy tracks deployed by the Vice’s network to ensnare the passing hormones, allowing these hormones to reach their intended destination.</p>
                    <p>AV are the perfect opposite of VG, and direct contact between the two results in the destruction of both particles. When AV and VG interact and destroy each other, a slight negative charge is left behind from the AV. Because of this, AV Shots often have light static shocks as a side effect, similar in intensity to the small zaps one can feel on a dry winter day. AV can also eat away at the tracks that make up the Vice’s network. The slight negative charge of AV can disrupt the bonds between VN, creating holes in the tracks and releasing the VN into the Host’s bloodstream to be disposed of and processed by the immune system.</p>
                    <p>As the production of AV became a more standard defense mechanism across the population, our bodies began to concentrate these molecules into tangible objects used to defend ourselves against advancing Vices, known as patches.</p>
                    <p>A patch is a densely-packed concentration of AV—often in the shape of simple, traditional weapons—that can help Hosts and Adjuncts successfully address Branches. Patches summoned outside of the Branch Domain have a fluid, shifting form that emanates a bright, cool light due to its composition of AV. Within the Branch Domain, patches have a more solid and detailed form with flourishes and details unique to both its weapon class and the Host it belongs to.</p>
                    <p>For example, if two Hosts have patches that imitate swords, one could have a simpler design while the other has engravings and embedded jewels. These differences in design often pull from the Host’s personal experiences, and can even go so far as to mimic actual objects from the Host’s life. A Host can also have multiple patches at once, though they will be the same and often at the expense of overall size. Examples include dual handaxes and collections of throwing stars.</p>
                    <p>During staging, a patch can be used to threaten the Vice core or render the Host unconscious without making contact so the Vice is forced to prematurely terminate the Branch. During production, a patch can deal devastating damage to both the Vice core and its exhibition. Learn more below in Wielding a Patch.</p>
                    <p>Patches are typically created as a direct reaction to having a Vice, though the circumstances in which they are created vary greatly between Hosts. Some Hosts receive their patches early in their Vice’s life cycle, while others can take years. Patches are still able to be summoned even after the Vice has been rescinded. If a Host contracts another Vice after rescission, their initial patch is likely to change shape over time to properly defend against the newly contracted Vice.</p>
                    <p>The process outlined below details the process of a Host establishing their first patch.</p>
                    <h2>Establishing a Patch</h2>
                    <p>Patches are first observed in a Host as a burst of AV and can present in multiple ways, often emitted from the nose, mouth or pores. Many Hosts recall a light tickle in the back of the throat that results in a sparkling cough or sneeze, or a chalky residue on their hands that leaves a trail of shimmering dust.</p>
                    <p>Establishing a patch takes time, roughly two to three weeks depending on its intended complexity. While it starts as an amorphous cloud of dust, over the next few weeks, the body learns how to properly concentrate and form the expelled AV and the patch begins to take its shape. Summoning Gloves and other Hosts can help to speed up the process by aiding in the output of AV, though many report that this expedited process can be unbearably painful if forced too quickly.</p>
                    <p>The final structure of the patch cannot be chosen and is understood to be determined by the body itself, influencing the shape to best combat the Vice’s exhibition. For example, if a Vice’s exhibition has a defensive outer shell, a large blunt weapon like a hammer or club may be established. While patches are generally considered to be intentionally designed, not all patches end up being helpful in the Branch Domain. In this instance, we recommend enlisting the help of Adjuncts or CVRS agents with the desired patch design. Alternatively, a patch can also be contracted.</p>
                    <h3>Patch Coaching</h3>
                    <p>In the event of unhelpful or insufficient patch establishment, an AV Specialist can work with patients to influence the design and function of their patch to better suit combat in the Branch Domain. AV Specialists are unique agents who are able to influence a Host’s patch design with repeated hand-to-hand sessions. Patches that have received coaching still belong to the Host, but are simply taking a temporary form influenced by an AV Specialist. Learn more about this process in <a href="../../services/primary-care/patch-coaching.html">Patch Coaching</a>.</p>
                    <h2>Summoning a Patch</h2>
                    <p>After a patch is properly established, an inexplicable warmth can be felt in the palms, signaling that it is ready to be summoned. The patch can now be summoned at will through the body’s summoning site, which is in the palm of the Host’s dominant hand by default. When first summoning a patch, a Host must become aware of the AV flowing through their body in order to reroute it to the summoning site, ultimately spawning the patch. This is likely to take multiple tries and requires patience. We encourage rehearsing the process during slower times so that it will come naturally when the situation is urgent. This same mindfulness is required to relocate a summoning site, wherein a Host must concentrate on the flow of AV to migrate the summoning site throughout the body to the desired location.</p>
                    <p>In its early stages, a summoned patch can be wielded as intended, though its efficacy is typically low due to its lower structural density. With time and repeated practice, the structural integrity strengthens and is able to both deliver and receive blows without much compromise. Summoning gloves are used by CVRS agents to boost their body’s output of AV and effortlessly summon their patch. Alternatively, Hosts can be referred to an AV Specialist to receive AV enhancement therapy to naturally bolster their AV production.</p>
                    <h2>Wielding a Patch</h2>
                    <p>Patches can be utilized during staging to suspend a Branch or during production to commit or rescind a Branch. It is important to understand the structural differences between these two options, as these differences will impact how the patch is handled. During staging, the patch has a bright, fluid form due to its composition of AV, but within the Branch Domain, the patch is detailed and solid, closely resembling the weapon it mimics.</p>
                    <h3>During Staging</h3>
                    <p>Effectively wielding a patch during staging requires immense concentration. Though it can generally retain its shape while being held, once movement is introduced, its form becomes less rigid and can “smear”, spreading its AV across a wider surface area and reducing its efficacy. The same mindfulness needed for summoning and site migration should also be applied when wielding a patch during staging. With dedicated practice, it comes more naturally, and less concentration is needed.</p>
                    <p>Patches tend to degrade more quickly outside of the Branch Domain as well, so precision and timeliness are the keys to success. Summoning Gloves can be used to “stabilize” the fluid composition of patches by increasing the output of AV and solidifying its form. This results in lower AV lost from contact and aids in accuracy.</p>
                    <h4 class="has-label" id="merging-patches">Merging Patches <span class="label label--red">New</span></h4>
                    <p>The concept of merging patches is a relatively new phenomenon quickly gaining popularity as a new approach to addressing Branches, most often exercised by peers, rather than CVRS agents. Patches can only be merged during staging, outside of the Branch Domain, where their composition is the most fluid and malleable. While there are no interpersonal requirements to merging patches, many have reported higher rates of success when merging the patches of the Host and their primary Adjunct(s). The act of two Adjuncts merging a patch has been reported, but not documented.</p>
                    <p>The process of merging patches is as straightforward as it sounds and entails simply “mashing” the two patches together gently, so as to not damage them. The structure and details of the merged patch will only be visible once the Adjunct(s) has entered the Branch Domain and the Branch is in production.</p>
                    <p>It should be noted that the end product will not always be helpful, nor is stability always guaranteed. A merged patch can be wielded by either party, but two separate patches will always merge into one, so one half of the party will not enter the Branch Domain with a patch. Dual patches merged with single patches can result in either one or two merged patches. Two sets of dual patches are likely to result in a dual merged patch, and so on. Dual merged patches can simultaneously be wielded by both of the owners.</p>
                    <p>After the Branch has terminated, merged patches are separated into their pre-merged compositions and returned to their respective owners. Merging is not guaranteed to result in the same product every time—nor is merging guaranteed to be successful every time—and should not be relied on as a method for addressing Branches. The act of merging patches is a novel concept and has not been studied thoroughly. Research and case studies are currently being conducted by our body of Branch Analysts. Due to its variability, CVRS cannot recommend merging patches as a viable method in addressing Branches, and instead recommends establishing a care team with various patch options.</p>
                    <h3>During Production</h3>
                    <p>Wielding a patch during production comes much more naturally and requires less concentration, as the Branch Domain is the intended environment for a patch. When a patch is used against a Vice’s exhibition, both will be damaged in the process.</p>
                    <p>Summoning Gloves donned before production will also be present in the Branch Domain and can aid in bolstering a patch’s makeup. This is particularly helpful for newly-established patches, which can otherwise become overloaded when subjected to repeated blows in quick succession. Those planning to wield a patch in the Branch Domain often summon it outside of the Branch Domain before making contact with the Host in staging.</p>
                    <p>“Thrown” weapons like arrows or handaxes can easily be sent off, and then summoned back within the wielder’s range. Doing so entails decommissioning the weapon and then re-summoning it.</p>
                    <h4 class="has-label" id="enhancing-patches">Enhancing Patches <span class="label label--red">New</span></h4>
                    <p>During production, patches can be combined with objects found around the Branch Domain, in a process known as patch enhancement. Not every combination yields a viable product, but if a patch is compatible with an object, there will be a brief shift in the patch’s makeup, resulting in what feels like a quick burst of haptic feedback.</p>
                    <p>Patch enhancement also performs differently depending on the patch’s maturity. Younger patches are more susceptible to enhancement, but often yield less helpful results. More mature patches tend to be more discerning in what objects it deigns to fuse with, but yields stronger, more durable and complex results.</p>
                    <p>Patch enhancements are typically performed to bolster a patch or increase its damage output. For example, a club combined with a brick can become a greathammer. Patch enhancement can even be used to alter the function of a patch. For example, a small dagger patch combined with a wooden broom handle can become a javelin. The combination possibilities are endless, bound only by the limits of the Branch Domain. Patch enhancements are not permanent, but do maintain consistency between Branches. It is relatively difficult and time-consuming, but an enhanced patch is capable of being undone. Enhanced patches with a higher complexity are typically more difficult to undo, and the act of undoing an enhancement will vary between combinations.</p>
                    <p>Patch enhancement is, however, limited to the objects found in the Branch Domain of a Branch initiated by a Host’s Vice. That is to say, an Adjunct cannot perform patch enhancement in the Branch Domain of another Host’s Vice. Though these modifications do carry over to other Branch Domains if performed in the Host’s original Branch Domain.</p>
                    <h2>Patch Maintenance</h2>
                    <p>Within the Branch Domain, and during staging especially, a patch will degrade as it comes in contact with VG. During staging, if a patch makes contact with a Host, the VG that have overwhelmed the body interact with the AV of the patch and neutralize each other. The same concept applies to the Branch Domain as well, where the patch neutralizes the Vice’s exhibition at the point of contact. Typically, patches degrade more quickly in the short minute of staging than they do within a Branch’s entire production, this being another reason why committing will always be recommended over suspension.</p>
                    <p>Over time, the body will naturally siphon AV to replenish what was lost. Rest and keeping stress low during this time can help speed up the process. AV Shots can also be administered if a patch was severely damaged, but should be done so with caution, as they can agitate the Vice or unintentionally instigate a Branch. Your Vice Management Administrator can refer you to an AV Specialist, who can provide AV enhancement therapy to bolster AV production without the risk of AV Shots.</p>
                    <h2>Types of Patches</h2>
                    <p>Generally speaking, patches are not limited to a set pool of options and have even strayed outside the realm of weapons in niche instances, but they are crafted with the sole intent to counter a Host’s Vice, which typically results in a weapon-like object. Patches are organized into the categories below, strictly based on the intent of the object.</p>
                    <dl class="desc-list">
                        <dt>Piercing</dt>
                        <dd><p>These patches are manifested with the intent to stab and puncture thick hides or scales. Examples include short knives and daggers, thrown weapons like javelins or spears, long-range weapons like arrows or tridents, or more unconventional weapons like ice picks, needles, or darts.</p></dd>
                        <dt>Slashing</dt>
                        <dd><p>These patches are manifested with the intent to slash and cut through relatively fleshy, soft exhibitions. They can also be used to sever limbs or carve through excessive fat layers. Examples include weapons with large blades, such as axes and swords, serrated weapons like saws, or unconventional weapons such as bread knives or scalpels. Some weapons used for strangulation are included in this classification, such as piano wire and garrotes.</p></dd>
                        <dt>Bludgeoning</dt>
                        <dd>
                            <p>These patches are manifested with the intent to inflict blunt force trauma on the exhibition by damaging thick, outer shells or compromising skeletal structures. Examples include traditional weapons such as staffs, hammers, and clubs, while more modern examples include baseball bats and brass knuckles. Unconventional examples include lead pipes, golf clubs, and the ever-comical steel chair.</p>
                            <p>While the argument can be made that anything thrown with enough force could be classified as a bludgeoning weapon, what truly classifies a patch is the intent of the object. If bludgeoning is a secondary effect of the patch, such as the stock of a gun or the handle of an axe, it is not classified as bludgeoning.</p>
                        </dd>
                        <dt>Defensive</dt>
                        <dd><p>These patches have the express intention of shielding the Host or Adjunct from the exhibition’s attacks. Some consider defensive patches to be subclasses of bludgeoning patches, as they can also be used to inflict blunt damage in close range, though it still relies on intent, and these patches are manifested to defend. Examples include standard wood or metal shields, but can also extend to improvised shields like trash can lids or sheets of plywood. Improvised defensive patches are extremely rare, as defensive patches in general are already quite uncommon.</p></dd>
                        <dt>Fringe</dt>
                        <dd>
                            <p>A catchall grouping that houses patches that do not fit into any of the above categories. Because of this, patches that belong to this category often do not have any shared characteristics. “Fringe” does not necessarily mean “unconventional” in this instance, as some rare and unique patches can still be classified by the above categories due to the types of damage they can theoretically cause. Patches of all types have been classified as fringe, ranging from complex mechanical weapons like guns and grenades to non-damaging objects like sports balls, books, or nets.</p>
                            <p>While non-damaging weapons may seem counterintuitive to the purpose of patches, they were not manifested on a whim, and many Solutions Architects will urge Hosts to pay careful attention to a Vice’s behavior within the Branch Domain, as well as its exhibition, to discover ways in which these unique patches can swing the Branch in their favor.</p>
