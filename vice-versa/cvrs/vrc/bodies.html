                    </details>
                    <p>The statuses outlined below give caregivers an idea of Vice activity and can inform treatment plans. Blights also play a role in signaling a Vice’s intentions and can warn Hosts of an advancing Vice. As a form of defense, many Hosts are able to summon large concentrations of AV, called a patch, that can be used to defend oneself or protect others. Establishing a patch is often the body’s way of warning the Host of sudden, drastic changes in a Vice’s makeup.</p>
                    <h2 id="criteria">Infection Criteria</h2>
                    <p>Vices can be contracted at any age, though most people contract their first Vice between the ages of 15 and 25. Hosts as young as 4 and as old as 93 have been documented as contracting a Vice. While age does not necessarily impact classification, some classifications are less likely to be found in younger Hosts, such as <a href="./classes/lambda.html">Lambda Vices</a>.</p>
                    <p>The criteria for contracting a Vice cannot be simplified into an easily-digestible list. Any and all people are technically capable of contracting a Vice, though some have an increased risk. Those with weaker immune systems and people who have experienced recent or repeated trauma are at higher risk.</p>
                    <p>People are also able to contract multiple Vices throughout their life, having an increased risk if any of their previous Vices had a sudden advent or the <a href="./classes/phi.html">Phi classification</a>. Due to the complexity of Vices with a gradual advent, it is believed that the Host’s body has adapted to use a more well-rounded defense strategy and is better equipped to detect the vague physiological factors that result in a gradual advent.</p>
                    <h2 id="status">Host Status</h2>
                    <p>Hosts have a variety of statuses that communicate urgency and drive treatment plans. While a Host is infected, they can further be categorized by the degree that the Vice has spread within their body.</p>
                    <figure class="captioned-media">
                        <img class="border" src="./images/hoststatuses.jpg" alt="A flowchart depicting the Host statuses as outlined below."/>
                        <figcaption>
                            The above flowchart outlines the procession of Host statuses and what moves Hosts between them. Hosts spend the majority of their time as Infected - Stable, but can also be berserk and comatose while infected. Inaction results in a dispersed Host, while reforming a Vice results in a limited Host. Rescinding a Vice, regardless if the Host is stable, berserk, or comatose, results in a cleared Host.

                    </figure>
                    <h3>Latent</h3>
                    <p>This status is referred to primarily in retrospect, when agents are studying or discussing advent properties and the experiences that may influence a Vice’s Branch Policy. A Host’s physiological, biological, and even psychological status during latency can provide valuable information to CVRS agents and can even aid in classification. For example, Zeta Vices are often birthed after periods of extreme depression, while Delta Vices tend to manifest after drastic life changes.</p>
                    <h3>Infected</h3>
                    <p>A Host is officially infected once a Vice has been successfully detected with a Vitiumglomerorum Detection Scan (VGDS), the diagnostic screening performed by a <a href="#">Record Administrator</a> following a brief screening questionnaire. This rudimentary scan detects dense concentrations of VG in the Host’s body using a <a href="#">VG Meter</a>; a localized reading of 4.0 or higher indicates the presence of a Vice core.</p>
                    <p>After advent, the Vice’s core size and growth progress can be monitored with regular Vitiumglomerorum Management Scans (VGMS) administered by a Vice Management Specialist. These scans produce low-resolution black and white images much like an ultrasound and determine the size and density of the Vice core. Classification can now occur based on the information gathered at advent and its behavior between the initial Branches. Most Vices are classified within 6 months of advent.</p>
                    <p>Shortly after advent, the Host’s body begins producing antivitiumglomerorum (AV) as a direct response to the invasive parasite. Over time, an infected Host’s body will learn to control and concentrate the flow of AV, which can result in establishing a patch. Learn more about this process in <a href="#av">AV and Patches</a>.</p>
                    <p>While a Host is infected, they fall into one of three categories: stable, berserk, or comatose, with a fourth “liminal” status reserved for Hosts with reformed Vices. These sub-phases are determined by the Vice’s behavior and how the Host’s body is reacting to it, as outlined below.</p>
                    <h4>Stable</h4>
                    <p>While a Host is infected, they will spend the majority of their time in this phase. Being stable does not imply the Host is asymptomatic or not at risk; rather, it means that both the Host and the Vice are behaving “in character”. Blights are not agitated and the Vice core is not growing at an alarming or unnatural rate.</p>
                    <p>Hosts experiencing Branches are still considered stable, so long as the Vice is not performing excessive augmentation or germination. A stable Host’s immune system is on standby, monitoring the Vice core activity.</p>
                    <p>Stable Hosts do not typically exhibit blights, though Hosts with mature Vices will sometimes display consistent, mild blights such as sharpened incisors or small, nubby horns, known as <a href="#chronic">chronic blights</a>. These blights are caused by concentrations of VG rather than exacerbated Vice activity. Acute blights are typically only observed during Branches, and are expected to resolve after the Branch has been addressed.</p>
                    <h4>Berserk</h4>
                    <p>A Host becomes berserk when the Vice pursues core growth (augmentation) or the expansion of its network (germination) during a the production phase of a Branch. While Vices can augment their core and germinate outside of Branches, it is performed at a near-imperceptible pace that does not alert the Host’s immune system. The growth that results in a berserk Host is sudden and brazen, some Vices being able to double their core size during Branches.</p>
                    <p>During both germination and augmentation, the Host’s immune system is deploying its natural defenses against threats, which includes flooding the body with hormones like adrenaline and cortisol. As discussed in <a href="#av">AV and Patches</a>, our bodies have adapted to release AV alongside hormones as a defense mechanism against a Vice’s network deploying its tracks to ensnare the passing hormones. Because the body is being overrun with VG during this time--and because VG and AV cancel each other out--the AV is eventually overwhelmed by the sheer number of VG released from the Vice’s tracks. This steady supply of hormones fuels the Vice’s core growth and network expansion for the remainder of the Branch.</p>
                    <p>Due to the increase in VG throughout the body, blights are visibly agitated in this phase. Extrusion blights grow in size, drape blights expand in surface area, and expulsion blights increase their output. Berserk Hosts will have different reactions depending on their relation to the Branch Arena. Inside the Branch Arena, berserk Hosts can become erratic, impulsive, and even hostile. Outside of the Branch Arena, a Host’s muscles will be taut and their jaws are likely to be clenched, often resulting in small tremors that can manifest as hypnic jerks, which risk Adjuncts breaking contact with the Host. Berserk Hosts with weaker immune systems are also at risk of excessive sweating, uncontrollable coughing, emesis, and even seizures, even further increasing the risk of losing their Adjuncts.</p>
                    <p>If possible, it is highly recommended to pursue rescission if a Host is berserk. Committing a Branch will stabilize the Host, but there will be less time between Branches compared to committing Branches when a Host is stable. For example, if a Vice typically has two to three weeks of down time between committed Branches, committing a Branch while the Host is berserk will likely result in only a week of down time. Suspending the Branches of a berserk Host is likely to do more harm than good and should only be performed as a last resort. If a Branch goes unaddressed, a Host will become comatose as the Vice begins to initiate fusion.</p>
                    <h4>Comatose</h4>
                    <p>A Host becomes comatose once the Vice core has begun the process of fusing its recently expanded core with the Host’s body. Fusion is the process of the Vice core infiltrating organs and viscera and intertwining its makeup with these structures. As the contents of the Vice core mix with the viscera, this mixture becomes extremely rigid and solidifies, essentially killing the tissues it has fused with. Learn more about fusion in <a href="#">Reactivity and Defense Mechanisms</a>.</p>
                    <p>During this time, the Host’s body is shutting down and losing motor control. Because the core is often fused with hormone-secreting organs, such as the pituitary gland or brain stem, the overproduction of hormones is triggered even further, fueling the Vice’s continued expansion and fusion. Comatose Hosts exhibit the same physiological symptoms as berserk Hosts, though they do tend to be exacerbated. Because of the unrestrained release of hormones, Hosts can also develop severe acute reactions, such as serotonin syndrome or thyrotoxicosis.</p>
                    <p>Due to the increase in VG throughout the Host’s body, Blights are extremely agitated and out of control, potentially causing harm to those around them. Within the Branch Arena, Hosts may find it difficult to think clearly and make rational decisions. Some even feel like they have less control of their body and find it twice as difficult to move in the ways they intend to. Adjuncts are imperative to success in this phase.</p>
                    <p>While the core is fused with the Host’s body, doing so has stretched it extremely thin, making the core vulnerable in both the corporeal and metaphysical realms. Due to this vulnerable state, rescission is still achievable, even if a Host is comatose. If a Host is able to rescind their Vice during this phase, the Host will be cleared but will likely suffer extreme lingering blights and can even develop autoimmune disorders, damaged joints and chronic pain. In extreme cases, amputations or organ transplants may be needed. AV Shots may buy the Host time, but are ultimately futile at this phase, as the VG coursing throughout the Host’s body almost immediately defuses the burst of AV.</p>
                    <p>If a Host is unsuccessful at rescission, the Vice will complete the fusion process and begin the act of dispersion.</p>
                    <h4>Liminal</h4>
                    <p>In the rare instance of reformation, a Host can still be infected, but at a much lower risk of dispersion and Branch initiation. The components of a Vice are still present throughout a liminal Host’s bloodstream, but the core and its network are in a scattered, disconnected state. Vices that have been reformed cannot feed on hormones or initiate Branches, but they do have the very low probability of congealing and re-establishing the core. Hosts with reformed Vices are able to use their power to bolster their extension in the Branch Arena by taking on the form of its exhibition. Learn more about the process of Vice reformation in <a href="#">Fringe Branch Events</a>.</p>
                    <p>Reformed Vice cores are immediately dissolved in a fluid and scattered throughout the body, while the Vice’s network stays relatively intact, but cannot function as intended. While the general layout of the Vice’s network remains unchanged, it cannot transport VG or hormones. Because it has lost contact with the core, the network begins steadily leaking the remaining VG and hormones out into the Host’s bloodstream.</p>
                    <p>Due to the VG now circulating freely in the Host’s body, Hosts are much more susceptible to agitated, chronic blights. While annoying, these typically pose only minor threats, depending on the original severity of blights. AV Shots can be administered for blight management, but also lessens the time a Host is able to wield their reformed Vice. Liminal Hosts have reported being more sensitive and reactive during this time, generally attributed to the supplementary hormones leaching into the bloodstream.</p>
                    <p>Reformed Vices typically cycle through the Host’s bloodstream for roughly a year. The Host’s steady deployment of AV eats away at the scattered remains of the Vice core, but summoning the Vice’s exhibition in the Branch Arena can deplete the core by up to 50%. As the percentage of the core decreases, the severity of chronic blights decreases as well.</p>
                    <p>Rescission is the act of destroying a Vice core, so once the last bit of the core is passively destroyed by the body’s AV or it is used to bolster the Host’s extension in the Branch Arena, the Vice is officially rescinded. This process is not dissimilar to <a href="#">exposure rescission</a>. Even if a liminal Host has stopped having blights, it is recommended that they visit a Vice Management Specialist to confirm rescission.</p>
                    <h3>Cleared</h3>
                    <p>A cleared Host is the result of a successful rescission, which is only achieved once the Vice core is destroyed. Rescission can be achieved in multiple ways, further explored in <em>Services, Treatments &amp; Support</em> under <a href="#">Rescission</a>.</p>
                    <p>More mature Vices tend to leave trace amounts of its network behind after rescission. Similar to the experience of liminal Hosts, these lingering fragments can result in chronic blights, though they are often much less severe, as the remaining network of a rescinded Vice tends to be relatively incomplete. A Vice Management Specialist or Blight Specialist can help with lingering blights and facilitate post-rescission treatment, if needed.</p>
                    <p>Cleared Hosts become more susceptible to contracting another Vice as time progresses. Experts posit that cleared Hosts have a higher tolerance to VG and consequently require a higher concentration of it to spark another advent, but over time, this tolerance is likely to lower.</p>

                        <span class="alert__heading">Content Warning</span>
                        <p>The passages below contain information that may be uncomfortable for some readers. The act of dispersion entails the mutilation of the human body, which is outlined in detail below. Proceed with caution or <a href="#blights">skip to the next section</a>.</p>
                    </div>
                    <h3>Dispersed</h3>
                    <p>This status is applied to Hosts postmortem, as the process of dispersion kills the Host. Dispersion is the result of an unaddressed Branch, where a Vice was able to expand its core throughout a comatose Host’s body and perform the act of fusion, wherein its entangled core hardens and clings onto the organs and viscera around it.</p>
                    <p>In the blink of an eye, the Host’s body is sucked in on itself and absorbed into the Vice’s core. It quickly recedes into a dense ball of flesh, no more than two inches, then explodes in a violent burst that sends a wave of VG in every direction.</p>
                    <p>Hosts who have been dispersed are unable to be reclaimed, even in small amounts, as the act of retracting the Host’s body into the core liquefies its contents to be utilized as fuel for the explosive dispersion of VG. Learn more about this process in <a href=".biology.html/#reproduction">Vice Reproduction</a>.</p>
                    <h2 id="blights">What are Blights?</h2>
                    <p>In the same way the immune system might prompt a rash when battling a virus, blights are the body’s response to being infected with a Vice. Blights are influenced by the Vice’s exhibition and can be a valuable insight into possible changes to the exhibition between Branches. Blights also give insight into a Vice’s activity, as more aggressive blights are indicative of an advancing Vice core and should not be ignored.</p>
                    <p>Blights tend to mimic the Vice’s exhibition. For example, if a Vice's exhibition is covered in scales and exudes electricity, the Host is likely to have a couple patches of scales on their arms or face and lightly shock others when touching. If the Host progresses to a more severe status or the Vice is more mature, the Host might have their entire upper body covered in scales and have uncontrollable bouts of electric pulses.</p>
                    <p>Blights themselves are extensions of our body, typically triggered by dense concentrations of tracks in a Vice’s network. For this reason, complex, full-body blights are typically only observed in adolescent and mature Vices. Blights are not unique to older Vices, however, as expulsion blights are often observed during the larval stage.</p>
                    <h3>Acute vs. Chronic</h3>
                    <p>When discussing the impact of blights, it is important to also include the duration of the condition, as acute and chronic blights signal different Vice behavior to a Blight Specialist or Vice Management Specialist. Acute blights are sudden, drastic changes in size, number or surface area, including the onset of new blights. Chronic blights tend to be less severe, and refer to those that have remained visible for over 6 months, despite fluctuations in Vice activity. Acute blights indicate a sudden change in Vice behavior, such as Branch initiation or a reroute in resources, while chronic blights suggest a mature Vice has a well-established network.</p>
                    <h3>Types of Blights</h3>
                    <p>Blights can be split into four categories: expulsion, drape, extrusion, and pseudo. These categories give insight to blight behavior and can help Vice Management Specialists and Blight Specialists determine treatment.</p>
                    <h4>Expulsion Blights</h4>
                    <p>As the name suggests, expulsion blights begin in the body, but are ultimately expelled. These blights originate around the Vice core and exit the Host through the mouth, nose, ears, or pores. Most Hosts only have one expulsion blight at a time, which are often the first blight observed, as they are the only type of blight visible during the larval stage.</p>
                    <p>Because of their proximity to the Vice core, expulsion blights are highly reactive and tend to exhibit the most drastic change in volume in response to initiated Branches and core augmentation. Expulsion blights that mimic dangerous or harmful substances do not harm the Host, but can harm others on contact.</p>
                    <p>Examples of expulsion blights include smoke, static, and acid. Not all Hosts have expulsion blights, as they are dependent on the Vice’s exhibition. The less complex exhibitions of Vices with lower threat levels typically do not have characteristics that easily translate into expulsion blights.</p>
                    <h4>Drape Blights</h4>
                    <p>Drape blights lay close to the skin, rarely straying far from the Host’s body. These blights begin, and often stay, in localized patches across the skin and are sometimes considered the “heat map” of the Vice’s network. Collections of tracks found in junctions like shoulders and knees tend to contain dense concentrations of VG, triggering the production of these drape blights. In severe cases, they have been known to cover a Host’s entire body.</p>
                    <p>When agitated, drape blights are itchy, prompting many to pick at these patches. These blights can be removed from the skin, but often leave behind welts and lesions that can easily become infected if not properly cared for.</p>
                    <p>Examples most commonly include fur, scales, and feathers; though, some Hosts have noted unconventional presentation of these features, such as velvety scales or leathery patches lined with fur. Drape blights are more often observed in Vices with a higher threat level, likely due to the Vice’s established network.</p>
                    <h4>Extrusion Blights</h4>
                    <p>Extrusion blights are unnatural extensions of a Host’s body, typically originating and extruding from existing bone or deep within tissues. Extrusion blights from bone are stationery, while those that originate from tissues are able to be manipulated and articulated. These are the most commonly observed blights and have been known to present in many different ways, Hosts often being inflicted with multiple extrusion blights at a time.</p>
                    <p>The larger and further away from the body an extrusion blight is, the more sensitive or painful the base becomes due to strain. Extrusion blights are often heavy, dense, and uncomfortable, and larger blights often drive Hosts to seek treatment. Examples of smaller extrusion blights are fangs, blunt horns, and claws, while larger, more painful extrusion blights can be tails, long horns, wings, or spikes.</p>
                    <p>Many Vice Management Specialists and Blight Specialists measure the growth of these blights as a quick, non-invasive indicator of the Vice’s progress, as larger, more prominent extrusion blights directly correlate with increased core size. Because of this, comatose Hosts are typically overwhelmed by their extrusion blights, resulting in a deep-seated pain that resonates throughout the body. Chronic blights are most commonly extrusion blights.</p>
                    <h4>Pseudo Blights</h4>
                    <p>Pseudo blights are lingering blights that remain even after a Vice has been rescinded. These blights are often the result of more mature Vices that put a strain on the Host’s immune system and have left traces of its network behind; though, they can also be the result of a reformed Vice due to the VG and fragments of the Vice’s core are scattered throughout the Host’s body.</p>
                    <p>While pseudo blights can be any of the types listed above, drape blights tend to be the most common, as the denser collections of tracks found in the shoulders and knees when the network is active are the fragments most commonly left behind after rescission. These blights are typically more brittle and only manifest in scattered patches, rather than dense swaths of scales and feathers. These blights can easily be removed from the skin and are less likely to leave lesions when doing so.</p>
                    <p>After the Host has been cleared, the immune system and hormone levels can take roughly a month to equalize as it works to address any remaining traces of the Vice. Liminal Hosts are likely to deal with blights for the duration of their reformed Vice’s lifespan, which lasts typically no more than a year.</p>
                    <h3>Treating Blights</h3>
                    <p>Excessive blights can be treated with Suppressants, often administered by a Vice Management Specialist or Blight Specialist. Though, it is important to keep in mind that the manifestation of blights is a way in which our bodies communicate with us, and excessive blights are often indicative of an underlying issue. Suppressants should only be administered as a means of providing relief and not as a form of treatment. Learn more about Suppressants in <a href="#">Services, Treatments &amp; Support</a>.</p>
                    <p>Cleared and liminal Hosts may pursue additional treatment for their psuedo blights, typically from a Blight Specialist. In the case of liminal Hosts, a Blight Specialist will likely prescribe a single dose of Suppressants to provide relief for lingering blights without impacting the remaining core; whereas, cleared Hosts can benefit from AV Shots and AV enhancement therapies to break up any remaining network fragments. Learn more about these options in <a href="#">Services, Treatments &amp; Support</a>.</p>
                    <h2 id="av">AV and Patches</h2>
                    <p>As Vices have evolved, so, too, have our bodies. Roughly thirty years ago, in direct response to the growing complexity of Vices, our bodies began producing and releasing a counter-molecule called antivitumglomerorum (AV, plural: antivitiumglomerora). While all bodies are capable of doing so, a Host’s body only only begins generating AV once it detects the advent of a Vice.</p>
                    <p>AV is stored and distributed in varying ways between Hosts. Depending on the location of the Vice core, various organs have adapted to produce AV, such as the adrenal glands, hypothalamus, and liver. AV is typically deployed in tandem with the hormones released as a stress response. The AV released alongside hormones attack the thin, wispy tracks deployed by the Vice’s network to ensnare the passing hormones, allowing these hormones to reach their intended destination.</p>
                    <p>AV are the perfect opposite of VG, and direct contact between the two results in the destruction of both particles. Because vitiumnexa (VN, singular: vitiumnexum)—what the tracks in the Vice’s network are comprised of—share a similar composition with VG, AV are also capable of breaking them down, though they do tend to leave behind a positive charge in the process. Because of this, AV Shots often have light static shocks as a side effect, similar in intensity to the small zaps one can feel on a dry winter day.</p>
                    <p>As the production of AV became a more standard defense mechanism across the population, our bodies began to concentrate these molecules into tangible objects used to defend ourselves against advancing Vices, known as patches.</p>
                    <p>A patch is a densely-packed concentration of AV—often in the shape of simple, traditional weapons—that can help Hosts and Adjuncts successfully address Branches. Patches summoned outside of the Branch Arena have a fluid, shifting form that emanates a bright, cool light due to its composition of AV. Within the Branch Arena, patches have a more solid and detailed form with flourishes and details unique to both its weapon class and the Host it belongs to.</p>
                    <p>For example, if two Hosts have patches that imitate swords, one could have a simpler design while the other has engravings and embedded jewels. These differences in design often pull from the Host’s personal experiences, and can even go so far as to mimic actual objects from the Host’s life. A Host can also have multiple patches at once, though they will be the same and often at the expense of overall size. Examples include dual handaxes and collections of throwing stars.</p>
                    <p>During staging, a patch can be used to threaten the Vice core or render the Host unconscious without making contact so the Vice is forced to prematurely terminate the Branch. During production, a patch can deal devastating damage to both the Vice core and its exhibition. Learn more below in <a href="#weild">Wielding a Patch</a>.</p>
                    <p>Patches are typically created as a direct reaction to having a Vice, though the circumstances in which they are created vary greatly between Hosts. Some Hosts receive their patches early in their Vice’s life cycle, while others can take years. Patches are still able to be summoned even after the Vice has been rescinded. If a Host contracts another Vice after rescission, their initial patch is likely to change shape over time to properly defend against the newly contracted Vice.</p>
                    <p>The process outlined below details the process of a Host establishing their first patch.</p>
                    <h3 id="establish">Establishing a Patch</h3>
                    <p>Patches are first observed in a Host as a burst of AV and can present in multiple ways, often emitted from the nose, mouth or pores. Many Hosts recall a light tickle in the back of the throat that results in a sparkling cough or sneeze, or a chalky residue on their hands that leaves a trail of shimmering dust.</p>
                    <p>Establishing a patch takes time, roughly two to three weeks depending on its intended complexity. While it starts as an amorphous cloud of dust, over the next few weeks, the body learns how to properly concentrate and form the expelled AV and the patch begins to take its shape. Summoning Gloves and other Hosts can help to speed up the process by aiding in the output of AV, though many report that this expedited process can be unbearably painful if forced too quickly.</p>
                    <p>The final structure of the patch cannot be chosen and is understood to be determined by the body itself, influencing the shape to best combat the Vice’s exhibition. For example, if a Vice’s exhibition has a defensive outer shell, a large blunt weapon like a hammer or club may be established. While patches are generally considered to be intentionally designed, not all patches end up being helpful in the Branch Arena. In this instance, we recommend enlisting the help of Adjuncts or CVRS agents with the desired patch design. Alternatively, a patch can also be contracted.</p>
                    <h4>Contracting a Patch</h4>
                    <p>In the event of an unhelpful patch, one may be contracted through your local CVRS Primary Care. Your Vice Management Specialist will refer you to an AV Specialist, who will work with you to determine the most helpful and efficient patch to contract. AV Specialists are unique agents who are able to influence a Host’s patch design with repeated hand-to-hand sessions. Contracted patches still belong to the Host, but are simply taking a temporary form influenced by an AV Specialist. Learn more about this process in <a href="#">Services, Treatments &amp; Support</a>.</p>
                    <h3 id="summon">Summoning a Patch</h3>
                    <p>After a patch is properly established, an inexplicable warmth can be felt in the palms, signaling that it is ready to be summoned. The patch can now be summoned at will through the body’s summoning site, which is in the palm of the Host’s dominant hand by default. When first summoning a patch, a Host must become aware of the AV flowing through their body in order to reroute it to the summoning site, ultimately spawning the patch. This is likely to take multiple tries and requires patience. We encourage rehearsing the process during slower times so that it will come naturally when the situation is urgent. This same mindfulness is required to relocate a summoning site, wherein a Host must concentrate on the flow of AV to migrate the summoning site throughout the body to the desired location.</p>
                    <p>In its early stages, a summoned patch can be wielded as intended, though its efficacy is typically low due to its lower structural density. With time and repeated practice, the structural integrity strengthens and is able to both deliver and receive blows without much compromise. Summoning gloves are used by CVRS agents to boost their body’s output of AV and effortlessly summon their patch. Alternatively, Hosts can be referred to an AV Specialist to receive AV enhancement therapy to naturally bolster their AV production.</p>
                    <h3 id="wield">Wielding a Patch</h3>
                    <p>Patches can be utilized during staging to suspend a Branch or during production to commit or rescind a Branch. It is important to understand the structural differences between these two options, as these differences will impact how the patch is handled. During staging, the patch has a bright, fluid form due to its composition of AV, but within the Branch Arena, the patch is detailed and solid, closely resembling the weapon it mimics.</p>
                    <h4>During Staging</h4>
                    <p>Effectively wielding a patch during staging requires immense concentration. Though it can generally retain its shape while being held, once movement is introduced, its form becomes less rigid and can “smear”, spreading its AV across a wider surface area and reducing its efficacy. The same mindfulness needed for summoning and site migration should also be applied when wielding a patch during staging. With dedicated practice, it comes more naturally, and less concentration is needed.</p>
                    <p>Patches tend to degrade more quickly outside of the Branch Arena as well, so precision and timeliness are the keys to success. <a href="#">Summoning Gloves</a> can be used to “stabilize” the fluid composition of patches by increasing the output of AV and solidifying its form. This results in lower AV lost from contact and aids in accuracy.</p>
                    <h5>Merging Patches (new)</h5>
                    <p>The concept of merging patches is a relatively new phenomenon quickly gaining popularity as a new approach to addressing Branches, most often exercised by peers, rather than CVRS agents. Patches can only be merged during staging, outside of the Branch Arena, where their composition is the most fluid and malleable. While there are no interpersonal requirements to merging patches, many have reported higher rates of success when merging the patches of the Host and their primary Adjunct(s). The act of two Adjuncts merging a patch has been reported, but not documented.</p>
                    <p>The process of merging patches is as straightforward as it sounds and entails simply “mashing” the two patches together gently, so as to not damage them. The structure and details of the merged patch will only be visible once the Adjunct(s) has entered the Branch Arena and the Branch is in production.</p>
                    <p>It should be noted that the end product will not always be helpful, nor is stability always guaranteed. A merged patch can be wielded by either party, but two separate patches will always merge into one, so one half of the party will not enter the Branch Arena with a patch. Dual patches merged with single patches can result in either one or two merged patches. Two sets of dual patches are likely to result in a dual merged patch, and so on. Dual merged patches can simultaneously be wielded by both of the owners.</p>
                    <p>After the Branch has terminated, merged patches are separated into their pre-merged compositions and returned to their respective owners. Merging is not guaranteed to result in the same product every time—nor is merging guaranteed to be successful every time—and should not be relied on as a method for addressing Branches. The act of merging patches is a novel concept and has not been studied thoroughly. Research and case studies are currently being conducted by our body of Branch Analysts. Due to its variability, CVRS cannot recommend merging patches as a viable method in addressing Branches, and instead recommends establishing a care team with various patch options.</p>
                    <h4>During Production</h4>
                    <p>Wielding a patch during production comes much more naturally and requires less concentration, as the Branch Arena is the intended environment for a patch. When a patch is used against a Vice’s exhibition, both will be damaged in the process.</p>
                    <p>Summoning Gloves donned before production will also be present in the Branch Arena and can aid in bolstering a patch’s makeup. This is particularly helpful for newly-established patches, which can otherwise become overloaded when subjected to repeated blows in quick succession. Those planning to wield a patch in the Branch Arena often summon it outside of the Branch Arena before making contact with the Host in staging.</p>
                    <p>“Thrown” weapons like arrows or handaxes can easily be sent off, and then summoned back within the wielder’s range. Doing so entails decommissioning the weapon and then re-summoning it.</p>
                    <h5>Enhancing Patches (new)</h5>
                    <p>During production, patches can be combined with objects found around the Branch Arena, in a process known as patch enhancement. Not every combination yields a viable product, but if a patch is compatible with an object, there will be a brief shift in the patch’s makeup, resulting in what feels like a quick burst of haptic feedback.</p>
                    <p>Patch enhancement also performs differently depending on the patch’s maturity. Younger patches are more susceptible to enhancement, but often yield less helpful results. More mature patches tend to be more discerning in what objects it deigns to fuse with, but yields stronger, more durable and complex results.</p>
                    <p>Patch enhancements are typically performed to bolster a patch or increase its damage output. For example, a club combined with a brick can become a greathammer. Patch enhancement can even be used to alter the function of a patch. For example, a small dagger patch combined with a wooden broom handle can become a javelin. The combination possibilities are endless, bound only by the limits of the Branch Arena. Patch enhancements are not permanent, but do maintain consistency between Branches. It is relatively difficult and time-consuming, but an enhanced patch is capable of being undone. Enhanced patches with a higher complexity are typically more difficult to undo, and the act of undoing an enhancement will vary between combinations.</p>
                    <p>Patch enhancement is, however, limited to the objects found in the Branch Arena of a Branch initiated by a Host’s Vice. That is to say, an Adjunct cannot perform patch enhancement in the Branch Arena of another Host’s Vice. Though these modifications do carry over to other Branch Arenas if performed in the Host’s original Branch Arena.</p>
                    <h3>Patch Maintenance</h3>
                    <p>Within the Branch Arena, and during staging especially, a patch will degrade as it comes in contact with VG. During staging, if a patch makes contact with a Host, the VG that have overwhelmed the body interact with the AV of the patch and neutralize each other. The same concept applies to the Branch Arena as well, where the patch neutralizes the Vice’s exhibition at the point of contact. Typically, patches degrade more quickly in the short minute of staging than they do within a Branch’s entire production, this being another reason why committing will always be recommended over suspension.</p>
                    <p>Over time, the body will naturally siphon AV to replenish what was lost. Rest and keeping stress low during this time can help speed up the process. AV Shots can also be administered if a patch was severely damaged, but should be done so with caution, as they can agitate the Vice or unintentionally instigate a Branch. Your Vice Management Specialist can refer you to an AV Specialist, who can provide AV enhancement therapy to bolster AV production without the risk of AV Shots.</p>
                    <h3>Types of Patches</h3>
                    <p>Generally speaking, patches are not limited to a set pool of options and have even strayed outside the realm of weapons in niche instances, but they are crafted with the sole intent to counter a Host’s Vice, which typically results in a weapon-like object. Patches are organized into the categories below, strictly based on the intent of the object.</p>
                    <dl class="desc-list">
                        <dt>Piercing</dt>
                        <dd>These patches are manifested with the intent to stab and puncture thick hides or scales. Examples include short knives and daggers, thrown weapons like javelins or spears, long-range weapons like arrows or tridents, or more unconventional weapons like ice picks, needles, or darts.</dd>
                        <dt>Slashing</dt>
                        <dd>These patches are manifested with the intent to slash and cut through relatively fleshy, soft exhibitions. They can also be used to sever limbs or carve through excessive fat layers. Examples include weapons with large blades, such as axes and swords, serrated weapons like saws, or unconventional weapons such as bread knives or scalpels. Some weapons used for strangulation are included in this classification, such as piano wire and garrotes.</dd>
                        <dt>Bludgeoning</dt>
                        <dd>
                            <p>These patches are manifested with the intent to inflict blunt force trauma on the exhibition by damaging thick, outer shells or compromising skeletal structures. Examples include traditional weapons such as staffs, hammers, and clubs, while more modern examples include baseball bats and brass knuckles. Unconventional examples include lead pipes, golf clubs, and the ever-comical steel chair.</p>
                            <p>While the argument can be made that anything thrown with enough force could be classified as a bludgeoning weapon, what truly classifies a patch is the intent of the object. If bludgeoning is a secondary effect of the patch, such as the stock of a gun or the handle of an axe, it is not classified as bludgeoning.</p>
                        </dd>
                        <dt>Defensive</dt>
                        <dd>These patches have the express intention of shielding the Host or Adjunct from the exhibition’s attacks. Some consider defensive patches to be subclasses of bludgeoning patches, as they can also be used to inflict blunt damage in close range, though it still relies on intent, and these patches are manifested to defend. Examples include standard wood or metal shields, but can also extend to improvised shields like trash can lids or sheets of plywood. Improvised defensive patches are extremely rare, as defensive patches in general are already quite uncommon.</dd>
                        <dt>Fringe</dt>
                        <dd>
                            <p>A catchall grouping that houses patches that do not fit into any of the above categories. Because of this, patches that belong to this category often do not have any shared characteristics. “Fringe” does not necessarily mean “unconventional” in this instance, as some rare and unique patches can still be classified by the above categories due to the types of damage they can theoretically cause. Patches of all types have been classified as fringe, ranging from complex mechanical weapons like guns and grenades to non-damaging objects like sports balls, books, or nets.</p>
                            <p>While non-damaging weapons may seem counterintuitive to the purpose of patches, they were not manifested on a whim, and many Solutions Architects will urge Hosts to pay careful attention to a Vice’s behavior within the Branch Arena, as well as its exhibition, to discover ways in which these unique patches can swing the Branch in their favor.</p>
