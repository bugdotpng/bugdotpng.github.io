                      <p>Well, it was at the corner store again. So, you know, typical corner store stuff. I couldn't really smell much, just the usual funk. As for sounds, all I could hear was Danny's yapping. God, despite being antisocial, he sure talks a lot.</p>

Frankie chastized me for...well, she broke my spirit! Made me feel bad for helping people and called me stupid! Okay, well not exactly, but she made me feel stupid at least. All that was still fresh when Danny decided to throw a paint scraper at me and rub it in how much I fucked up. Swear they both get a kick outta making people feel like shit.</p>

                      <p>Now that's the big ticket question, huh? Can't it be both? I don't really think what the two of them said did all that much damage to me. It's not in my usual Branch Ops anyway. But it certainly didn't help! And honestly, I think I would've been fine if Danny hadn't come along and beat me with an emotional mallet. He's like that sometimes. I think he likes to make other people feel bad because he hates himself so hard. In case you wanted my official psychological diagnosis. Assigned CUNT by yours truly.</p>

Only thing different this time was that Danny was there, and it wanted to use him as a chew toy. Didn't really expect it to go after him, but Danny probably looks like a dog bone to it, so I can't blame it for wanting to gnaw on him.</p>
