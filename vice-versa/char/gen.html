                <h2>Advent</h2>
                <p>Over the course of roughly three months, the patient experienced a gradual advent at age 14. Various emotions and circumstances contributed to advent, ranging from the stress of starting high school to the pressure to perform at an outrageously high level. The patient had a strained relationship with her parents—who the majority of the pressure stemmed from—and was also stressed about the well-being of a close friend. The multitude of emotions present during this gradual advent lent itself well to the Epsilon classification, though it was misclassified as Beta upon intake due to its gradual advent and persistent blights. The Vice core was verified with a VGDS after the patient was admitted for blight manifestation.</p>

                <h2>Record Activity</h2>

                    <p>Patient was confirmed to have lingering tracks and light pseudo Blights. A low, 3-month dose of Suppressants was prescribed to be used as needed. No followup required. Onus is on the patient to reach out if symptoms persist.</p>

                    <h3>Rescission Attempt [Primary Care]</h3>
                    <p>Patient was admitted to observation chambers to perform standard rescission, lead by her Vice Management Specialist with the support of a Branch Admin, Vice Management Coordinator, and Solutions Architect. Her primary Adjunct, Rami Hakim, was also in attendance. Upon Branch instigation, all 5 Adjuncts were properly admitted and queued during staging. Due to preparations made in the Pre-Rescission Assessment, Rescission was performed to completion in under 4 minutes, despite drastic changes to the Branch Arena.</p>

                    <p>Due to the urgency of the rogue Branch, the patient has elected to undergo the process of standard rescission, this decision supported by her Vice Management Specialist. Patient exhibited excellent understanding of the rescission process and agreed with the proposed plan based on the recent rogue Branch. Patient requested the presence of primary Adjunct, Rami Hakim.</p>

                    <p>Rogue Branch <span class="code">B1472730401-32</span> was initiated, but quickly suspended by the patient's primary Adjunct, Rami Hakim. The patient was immediately admitted to Urgent Care, where she was monitored for Vice activity after regaining consciousness. Patient noted inexplicable feelings of anxiety and urgency surrounding the rogue Branch and requested standard rescission be performed. After stability was confirmed, the Floor Manager referred the patient to Primary Care with instruction to perform rescission.</p>

                <h2>Adjunct Relationships</h2>
                <p>In addition to the primary Adjunct established through regular CVRS treatments, the patient also has a small support system she feels comfortable in addressing Branches initiated outside of treatment.</p>
                <span class="superhead">Primary Adjunct</span>
                <h3>Mitsuki Yoshida, Vice Management Specialist</h3>
                <p>Assigned to the patient shortly after advent, Mitsuki supported and guided the patient through her Vice journey with regular appointments and diligent assessments, instigating and committing many Branches throughout the Vice’s life cycle so as to analyze its behavior. Due to the Vice’s classification, she often sought the counsel of Solutions Architects and the support of Branch Admins.</p>
                <span class="superhead">Primary Adjunct</span>
                <h3>Rami Hakim</h3>
                <p>As the patient’s romantic partner, Rami has provided support for many of her Branches, particularly after the two began dating in late high school. While the patient was often prepared for the majority of her Branches, due to the Vice’s classification, many rogue Branches caught her by surprise. Throughout the Vice’s life cycle, Rami suspended two Branches and aided in committing three, one of which he committed himself, <span class="code">B1472730401-18</span>. The patient requested Rami’s presence during her scheduled rescission, where he supported the team well.</p>

                <span class="superhead">Secondary Adjunct</span>
                <h3>Emory Torres</h3>
                <p>As the childhood friend of Rami Hakim, Emory occasionally ran in the same circles as the patient, especially toward the end of high school and early college. While their patch was not well-suited to the exhibition, the patient most notably recalls their unorthodox approach to Branches, having a particularly unique perspective and able to conjure attack plans the patient nor her primary Adjunct would have thought of. Particularly notable was their contribution to the successful commit of <span class="code">B1472730401-16</span>. Despite not attending many Branches, the patient considers them a valuable asset in their Vice journey.</p>

                <h2>Patch Notes</h2>
                <p>Patient's patch was summoned after <span class="code">B1472730401-04</span>, particularly after a nasty bout of post-Branch blights. Patch formation was facilitated and expedited by her Vice Management Specialist, as she recognized early on the severity of her Vice. It resembles the scythes that the patient gravitated toward in video games and animated media, not modeled after a specific instance, but rather an amalgamation of inspiration from various sources. Patient has positive feelings toward her patch and feels that it represents and serves her well.</p>
                <figure class="captioned-media">
                  <img src="./images/gen-patch.jpg" alt="A technical line drawing of a fantasy scythe. It has two handles like an agricultural scythe and a large obsidian blade.">
                </figure>
                <h3>Efficacy</h3>
                <p>The patient’s patch is well-suited to the exhibition, its large blade able to inflict massive damage on the exhibition’s frail form. The difficulty in damaging lies in the exhibition’s ability to fly, though the scythe’s long metal staff serves the patient well in performing ranged attacks. Inspired by her secondary Adjunct, Emory Torres, when wielded around the lower handle and with enough momentum, it can be used as a thrown weapon to hit the exhibition when airborne.</p>
                <hr class="dashed"/>
                <h2>Branch Formula</h2>
                <p>Because of the Vice’s classification, Branch Formula changed often in the Vice’s life cycle, acting on different triggers depending upon which gave it the greatest advantage at the time. Triggers were primarily phrases similar to those said around the time of advent, though sometimes textures and specific foods triggered Branches as well, drawing from later stressors. Phrases included The drastic change in Branch formula and Branch Arena of <span class="code">B1472730401-05</span> earned a reclassification from Beta to Epsilon. Following <span class="code">B1472730401-12</span>, the Vice received the additional subclass of --gamma after the patient’s Vice Management Specialist observed the thoughtful curation and facilitation of Branches.</p>
                <h3>Changes</h3>
                <p>The exhibition shifted five times in the Vice’s life cycle, though it always maintained its capacity for flight. This led the Vice Management Specialist and Solutions Architects to infer that the core placement was in or around its wings, likely at the base, as proved to be the case.</p>
                <p>Branch Arenas tended to change quite drastically compared to its exhibition, focusing on recreating pixel-perfect renditions of scenery where the patient had experienced strong negative emotions in the past, examples including the alley behind her middle school, the kitchen in her childhood home, and the living room of her middle school violin teacher. While each change in the Branch Arena was relatively drastic, the height of the arena grew with each shift.</p>

                    </ul>
                    <p>The Branch was instigated in the observation chambers by the Branch Proctor. It was successfully instigated using a well-established track, and all Adjuncts were successfully queued. Due to instigation, staging was quite short compared to past staging times, at roughly 00:00:25C, 00:03:00M.</p>
                    <p>Upon entry, it was noted that the Branch Arena had changed drastically between productions. Where the previous Branch Arena was expansive and detailed, this Branch Arena was quite cramped, but extremely tall. The exhibition was hidden upon the start of production, presumed to be hovering toward the top of the arena, where it planned to simply stall the Branch as it pursued germination. Solutions Architect Gina Hahn verified this to be true, able to observe the arena from a wider point of view.</p>
                    <p>Branch Coordinator Craig Waters and Primary Adjunct Rami Hakim were able to use their throwing patches to injure the exhibition and force it to fall. As the exhibition came into view, it was noted that its lower body had been altered considerably: its legs were stronger, its talons were much larger, curved, and sharper, and a large, spiked tail was used as a whip-like weapon, wherein the exhibition had no tail before.</p>
                    <p>Immediately recognizing this threat, Gen was able to briefly utilize her scythe as a throwing weapon to sever the exhibition's lower body. Vice Management Specialist Mitsuki Yoshida rendered the exhibition's wings unusable with the use of her crossbow, causing it to finally fall, unable to move. Branch Admin Darrin Edwards delivered the final blow by driving his broadsword into the base of the exhibition's wing to destroy its core.</p>

                    <p>Initiation occurred during the patient's panic attack, of which she was having late in the evening at her partner and primary Adjunct Rami's house. Rami recalls the subject of the panic attack being along the lines of an existential crisis, a fear that her body of work had been a waste of time. He was able to recognize the warning signs of a rogue Branch (agitated bights and blown pupils, particularly) and felt the pull of staging shortly after.</p>
                    <p>Rami administered an AVShot he had on hand to perform suspension and terminate the Branch. The patient lost consciousness due to suspension. Rami admitted her to Urgent Care shortly after for monitoring. He stayed with the patient overnight and attended her Pre-Rescission Assessment the following day.</p>
