                <h2>Advent</h2>
                <p>The patient experienced a sudden advent at age 9, initiated by witnessing the death of his mother in the hospital. No Adjuncts were brought in to the resulting Branch: <span class="code">B1472480802-01</span>. Due to the patient's age, he could not recount the events of the Branch outside of standing face to face with a goat in a white room. The patient claims no events took place in the Branch Arena and the Branch was terminated by the Vice. Subsequent imaging could not locate the Vice core, leading to the classification of Phi.</p>
                <hr class="dashed"/>
                <h2>Record Activity</h2>
                <p>The patient’s record is quite sparse and has not been updated in over twenty years, but has remained active due to repeated requests from Station 147 Vice Management Specialist, <a href="./gen.html">Genesis Schwarzschild</a>, allegedly his primary Adjunct. Genesis has been researching Vice intelligence since her early college years and has used the patient’s file as an example in many research papers. CVRS neither confirms nor denies any claims made about intelligence, both in relation to the patient’s Vice or Vices as a whole.</p>
                <p>The patient’s admission history is listed below in reverse chronological order.</p>

                    <p>As a recent secondary Adjunct in <span class="code">B1473610100-23</span>, the patient was asked to complete an auxiliary Branch Recovery Interview. Agent <a href="./rami.html">Rami Hakim</a> insisted on conducting the interview in place of a Branch Recovery Specialist. Because both the Host and primary Adjunct offered detailed reports and due to the Host's sensitivity with regards to Vice-related discussions, only an auxiliary interview was performed. <a href="./danny/b1473610100-23.html">Read the full transcript here</a>.</p>

                    <h3 id="attempt">Rescission Attempt [Primary Care]</h3>
                    <p>Patient was admitted to observation chambers to perform rescission, lead by his Vice Management Specialist with the support of a Branch Coordinator. Patient displayed extreme obstinance in entering the observation chambers. Due to a clerical error, the Branch was instigated while no Adjuncts were in contact with the patient. Staging was uncharacteristically short, and Adjuncts had to join via multiple Backdoors, all of which failed, likely due to the newly-established network and weak tracks. Patient experienced unnaturally severe and complex blights, most notably a fully-functioning mouth split across his torso. Patient became berserk and was able to ambulate and speak despite being in production. The Branch was suddenly terminated and the patient fell unconscious, later unable to recount the events that took place inside the Branch Arena.</p>
                    <p>Patient was advised to continue visits after an altered treatment plan, but the patient’s guardian refused and terminated care.</p>

                    <h3>Blight Management Followup [Primary Care]</h3>
                    <p>The patient experienced no change in blight manifestation, and the patient’s guardian claimed an increase in severity to the point of debilitation. Patient had missed multiple consecutive days of school for uncontrollable blights. Vice Management Specialist suggested attempting standard rescission.</p>

                    <h3>Blight Management, Reclassification [Primary Care]</h3>
                    <p>Patient was admitted for blight management, as the increased dosage was not affecting the rate and severity of blight manifestation. Vice Management Specialist noted that the patient’s active blights seemed to not be emitting VG through her Parsing Goggles. Instead of performing a third VGDS, the Vice Management Specialist opted to perform a VGMS, which detected a lightly established network. The --omicron subclass was appended to the Phi classification.</p>
                    <p>Because the Vice core was still active, the patient was instructed to reach out at the first sign of a Branch. The patient’s Suppressants dosage was increased to the highest possible for his age group. Vice Management Specialist requested a two-week followup.</p>

                    <p>Patient was admitted for blight management, as the current prescription was not affecting blight manifestation. Under guidance of a Blight Specialist, the patient’s dosage was increased.</p>

                    <h3>Intake Followup [Primary Care]</h3>
                    <p>Patient’s guardian expressed concern about the patient’s excessive blights after intake. The patient’s guardian described his blights as follows:</p>
                    <ul>
                      <li>Tar/Oil/Sludge (expulsion blight; expelled via emesis)</li>
                      <li>Tall, spiral horns (extrusion blight)</li>
                      <li>Sharpened incisors (extrusion blight)</li>
                      <li>Spade-tipped tail (extrusion blight)</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>The patient's guardian also noted excessive nausea and fatigue leading up to advent.</p>
                    <p>A VGDS was performed again to verify past results, which came back negative. A 3-month round of Suppressants was prescribed under the supervision of a Blight Specialist. The patient’s guardian was assured that Pseudo Blights after a Phi Vice has been rescinded are quite common. Patient was instructed to take one pill twice a day and return for a followup appointment in three months.</p>

                    <h3>Patient Intake [Primary Care]</h3>
                    <p>The patient was admitted via Station 147 Primary Care, accompanied by his aunt, who claimed the patient experienced a sudden advent that resulted in a Branch. The Branch was supposedly terminated without any interference from the patient. After a brief oral interview, the patient was admitted to be seen by the Intake Manager.</p>
                    <p>The Intake Manager performed a VGDS to verify the presence of the Vice core and could not receive a reading. Considering the circumstances, the Phi classification was applied, and the patient was instructed to attend regular followup appointments to monitor any potential activity, as Phi Vices have a high rate of reignition.</p>

                <h2>Adjunct Relationships</h2>
                <p>No Adjuncts were established while the patient was regularly attending appointments. While it was not established while the patient was with CVRS, <a href="./gen.html">Genesis Schwarzschild</a> has identified herself as his primary Adjunct. The manor in which she interacts with the patient’s Branches is unknown.</p>
                <hr class="dashed"/>
                <h2>Branch Formula</h2>
                <p>The Branch Formula was not established while the patient was regularly attending appointments due to the lack of initiated Branches. In regards to the patient’s initial Branch initiated at advent, the Branch Arena was extremely simple, lacking in any memorable details. The patient claimed that the Vice’s exhibition resembled a sick, adult goat.</p>

                    <p>Due to the patient's age, he cannot recall many details about the Branch Arena or the Vice's exhibition. Patient claims to have stood in front of a sick-looking goat alone in a bright, white room. Branch was prematurely terminated by the Vice, resulting in a pseudo commit. Patient briefly lost consciousness after Branch was terminated.</p>
