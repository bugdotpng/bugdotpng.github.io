                <h2>Advent</h2>
                <p>The patient experienced a sudden advent at age 15, initiated due what the patient described as a panic attack, which was triggered after witnessing a public dispersal event (<span class="code">B2081320503-08</span>). The patient claims to have passed the Host as they initiated the process of dispersal and was directly within the dispersal radius. Emotions present at advent included helplessness, despair, and fear. Smells included cinnamon, popcorn and floral perfume, and tastes included a soft pretzel and blue raspberry slush. The sudden advent resulted in <span class="code">B1472940300-01</span>, wherein the patient was able to remove himself from the situation during staging to seclude himself during production. <span class="code">B1472940300-01</span> was experienced alone. The exhibition was relatively tame with the stocky build of a large vermin, much like a cross between an armadillo and possum. The Branch Arena was simple, mimicking the emergency exit hallway he had secluded himself in. Patient was able to successfully commit <span class="code">B1472940300-01</span> after damaging the core using manual force.</p>

                    <p>Patient experienced core shedding around approximately 02:15 a.m. and self-admitted to Urgent Care at 7:35 a.m. for threat assessment. Vitals were normal, and no threats were detected. Patient was released with instruction to return if blights were aggravated or a rogue Branch was initiated.</p>
                    <p>Patient noted acute memory loss, as is in line with previous shedding events. The patient has systems in place to aid in navigating this side effect and has refused to pursue regular treatment through CVRS.</p>

                    <p>Patient experienced core shedding around approximately 08:45 p.m. the night before and self-admitted to Urgent Care at 3:28 p.m. for threat assessment. Vitals were slightly elevated but not abnormal, and no threats were detected. Patient was released with instruction to return if blights were aggravated or a rogue Branch was initiated.</p>
                    <p>Patient noted relatively severe memory loss as a side effect of this core shedding. While acute memory loss is in line with previous shedding events, the degree of severity is typically not observed. The patient claims to have a good support system, as well as systems in place to aid in navigating this side effect. He continues to refuse pursuing regular treatment through CVRS.</p>

                <h2>Adjunct Relationships</h2>
                <p>Patient refuses Branch instigation treatment, and has thus not gained any CVRS Adjuncts. He tends to have Branches most commonly in intentional isolation and does not willingly accept the help of Adjuncts. Due to the low threat level, his Vice Management Specialist is not concerned. Despite insisting on handling his Branches alone, a few Adjuncts have aided in commits.</p>
                <span class="superhead">Primary Adjunct</span>
                <h3>Genesis Schwarzschild</h3>
                <p>As the patient’s partner, Gen has learned to recognize the signs of a potential core shedding, as well as impending Branches. She aided in committing <span class="code">B1472940300-06</span> and <span class="code">B1472940300-09</span>.</p>
                <p><a class="link" href="./gen.html">View Patient File for Genesis Schwarzschild</a></p>
                <span class="superhead">Secondary Adjunct</span>
                <h3>Emory Torres</h3>
                <p>As the patient’s best friend, Emory has aided in committing three Branches, providing much needed support and a fresh perspective, especially when experiencing new Branch formulae. These were Branches <span class="code">B1472940300-05</span>, <span class="code">B1472940300-07</span>, and <span class="code">B1472940300-08</span>.</p>

                <h2>Patch Notes</h2>
                <p>Patient’s patch was summoned between <span class="code">B1472940300-03</span> and <span class="code">B1472940300-04</span>, shortly after the core shed for the first time. Patient notified his Vice Management Specialist but performed patch establishment personally, aided by his partner Genesis Schwarzschild. The design of the patch likely pulls influence from the patient’s repeated visits to a local axe-throwing club, of which he frequented as an after-school activity for stress management.</p>
                <figure class="captioned-media">
                  <img src="./images/rami-patch.jpg" alt="A technical line drawing of two standard handaxes. They have wooden handles, rubber grips, and carbon steel heads.">
                </figure>
                <h3>Efficacy</h3>
                <p>Despite the exhibition’s stout build, it is quite speedy and requires precision to effectively damage, as it prioritizes dodging over attacking to prolong Branch times. Having a dual, thrown patch allows for repeated attacks from varying vantage points. When successful, the blades of these handaxes inflict considerable damage and immediately terminate the Branch. The patient’s patch is well-suited to combat his Vice, and will aid well in achieving rescission even if alone.</p>
                <hr class="dashed"/>
                <h2>Branch Formula</h2>
                <p>Because of the Vice’s classification, Branch Formula changed often in the Vice’s life cycle due to shedding. After the core shed for the first time, between <span class="code">B1472940300-03</span> and <span class="code">B1472940300-04</span>, the Branch formula began to pull from other stressful experiences, fundamentally altering its properties. Patient has noted a uniting theme in the Branch Formula, the stress of witnessing the suffering of a loved one, noted in his most recent Shedding Assessment.</p>
                <hr class="dashed"/>
                <h2>Branch History</h2>
                <p>While the patient has opted out of regular checkups, he does use his patient portal to log Branches and their high-level information as they occur. The patient claims it helps him keep track of the timeline and details.</p>
