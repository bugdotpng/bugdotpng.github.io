                      <p>Goddammit, Rami! I donâ€™t know! I just&mdash;I just got there! I just opened my eyes, and I was in the garage. I donâ€™t really know how to elaborate on that. Whatâ€™s the point in making me do this? Iâ€™m not going to be helpful! I had no idea what was going on!</p>

                      <p>Oh, it sucked. It was enough to get it to back off, but I barely injured it. Definitely wouldnâ€™t be able to defend myself with it if I was alone.</p>
