                <h2>Advent</h2>
                <p>The patient experienced a sudden advent at age 16, initiated due to a stressful argument with their father. This argument took place in the garage of their childhood home at night in the summer. Emotions present at advent were rage, pride, fear, and justice. Smells included gasoline, lumber, and fresh-cut grass. The resulting Branch (<span class="code">B1473610100-01</span>) brought in their 11-year-old sister as a secondary Adjunct, who they worked to protect against their newly obtained Vice. The Vice exhibition was initially quite erratic and frenzied, but quickly petered out as most newly-birthed Alpha Vices do. The patient was able to commit the Branch by using a plank of lumber to stab through its heart, resulting in damage to the core that sat between its shoulderblades.</p>
                <hr class="dashed"/>
                <h2>Record Activity</h2>
                <p>The patient's record is relatively spotty. They do not attend for regular maintenance, but rather only return to CVRS for rogue Branch recovery, which doesn't happen terribly often. When they were in high school, they seemed to be more disciplined in attending regular checkups, but after they graduated, they very rarely interacted with CVRS as a patient. Though, they began to interact with various CVRS stations in other ways. See <a href="#incidents">Record of Incidents</a> below.</p>
                <p>Because the patient's admission records were not accessed in over 10 years, they have been removed from the system, as is protocol. The patient's most recent admissions are listed below.</p>

                    <p>As a Host of <span class="code">B1473610100-23</span>, the patient was asked to complete a brief Branch Recovery Interview. Agent <a href="./rami.html">Rami Hakim</a> insisted on conducting the interview in place of a Branch Recovery Specialist. Because the Host had been under careful observation and assessment in Primary Care, only an auxiliary interview was performed. <a href="./emory/b1473610100-23.html">Read the full transcript here</a>.</p>

                    <p>The patient was admitted to Station 147 Primary Care after a Branch was committed to be seen by a Branch Recovery Specialist. Both the patient and the BRS are unsure whether or not <span class="code">B1473610100-23</span> should be classified as a rogue Branch, as its initiation shares some similarities with past Branches, but the patient was unprepared and caught off guard. For the sake of caution, it is currently being labeled as a rogue Branch, and a thorough investigation of the initiation site&mdash;the initiation site for many recent rogue Branches, such as <span class="code">B1472940200-13</span> and <span class="code">B1471980303-06</span>&mdash;has been requested as per the direction of their primary Adjunct and Station 147 Floor Manager, Rami Hakim.</p>
                    <p>Patient was monitored overnight and released the following morning, as no adverse reactions were observed.</p>

                <h2 id="incidents">Record of Incidents</h2>
                <p>Roughly one year ago, the patient began suspending what they perceived to be rogue Branches across the city, using their patch to incapacitate Hosts and terminate the Branch in what they described to be an act of public service. This has resulted in many complaints filed with CVRS, going so far as to label them not only a public nuisance, but also a public threat.</p>
                <p>Station 147 Public Deployment has been tasked with monitoring their behavior, but due to understaffing and the increase of local rogue Branches, they continue to subject the population to these unnecessary suspensions.</p>
                <span class="superhead">July 28, 2019</span>
                <h3 class="has-label">Update</h3>
                <p>Agents Frances Scott and Elias Mikhailov with Station 149 have been deployed to assist with the understaffing of Station 147 by taking on new cases. Suspensions seem to have stopped now that the two are involved, but we continue to keep a vigilant eye on them.</p>
                <hr class="dashed"/>
                <h2>Adjunct Relationships</h2>
                <p>Because of their spotty admission history and refusal to see a Vice Management Specialist regularly, the patient has no CVRS agents as Adjuncts, though they do have a solid team in place with a reliable primary and secondary Adjunct.</p>
                <span class="superhead">Primary Adjunct</span>
                <h3>Rami Hakim</h3>
                <p>Rami Hakim, the Floor Manager for Station 147 Urgent Care, is the patient's primary Adjunct, the two having known each other since early childhood. The two have a strong relationship and are prepared for multiple scenarios, having worked out multiple plans of attack outside of the Branch Arena. Rami is a dependable and talented primary Adjunct who hits reliably and knows the weak points of their Vice's exhibition. He recently committed <span class="code">B1473610100-23</span>. Of their 23 existing Branches, he has committed 18 and suspended two.</p>

                <span class="superhead">Secondary Adjunct</span>
                <h3>Adelaide Torres</h3>
                <p>Adelaide Torres is the patient's younger sister, having been brought in to the initial Branch that spawned at advent (<span class="code">B1473610100-01</span>). She did not contribute to committing the Branch and was unofficially banned from future Branches, as the patient refused to enlist her help so as to protect her from potentially adverse Branch results.</p>
                <span class="superhead">Secondary Adjunct</span>
                <h3>Genesis Schwarzschild</h3>
                <p>Gen Schwarzschild, a Vice Management Specialist for Station 147 Primary Care, is an occasional Adjunct who has helped commit a few Branches for them in the past, particularly when their primary Adjunct was unavailable. <span class="code">B1473610100-12</span> was the first Branch she was brought in intentionally as a secondary Adjunct to observe alongside their primary Adjunct, Rami Hakim. While less familiar with their exhibition, Gen is still a reliable secondary Adjunct who would be a valuable asset if rescission is pursued.</p>

                <h3 class="has-label">Daniel Su&aacute;rez</h3>
                <p>Danny Su&aacute;rez is a friend that was brought into <span class="code">B1473610100-23</span> by mistake, where he performed the role of Adjunct for the first time. While he did his best to fend off their Vice's exhibition and kept it distracted until help could arrive, we recommend excluding him from any future Branches, as his patch is not well-equipped to handle their exhibition and his lack of Branch Arena experience is potentially dangerous when facing a mature Vice.</p>

                <h2>Patch Notes</h2>
                <p>Their patch was summoned after <span class="code">B1473610100-03</span> and took a week and a half to fully form. It resembles a metal baseball bat and shares many similarities with the softball bat that belonged to their mother. The patient recalls looking up to their mother in their youth, excited to be old enough to use the bat, but lost respect as they grew older. The patient claimed that their patch was their way of taking something that they used to look up to in their naivety and innocence and making it their own, know having a clearer understanding of the world.</p>

                </figure>
                <h3>Efficacy</h3>
                <p>Their patch seemed to be a decent counter in the Vice's early larval stage and the handful of Branches that occurred during that time. Though, as the Vice matured to the adolescent stage, they began to notice a significant drop in efficacy, as the Vice's exhibition seemed to have devoted some energy to thickening its hide. Now that the Vice is fully mature, the support of their primary Adjunct&mdash;who wields a slashing patch&mdash;is imperative to success.</p>
                <hr class="dashed"/>
                <h2>Branch Formula</h2>
                <p>Because of their Vice's sudden advent, both their triggers and Branch Arena are relatively straightforward and predictable. The patient claims they were in an argument with their father, who was drunk and disorderly, and threatened the safety of their younger sister, Adelaide. Because of this, they are prone to Branch initiation during arguments, particularly those where their competence and ability to care for their sister are challenged. Seasoned Adjuncts have found success in removing them from the argument and distracting them.</p>
                <p>The Branch Arena mimics the garage of their childhood home, the place in which the argument took place. The arena is dark, as the argument happened in the evening, and has grown progressively darker as the Vice has matured. Its exhibition has warped dog-like features that likely pull from their internalized fear of dogs, resulting from being attacked by a Doberman when they were younger. This fear seems to have influenced the exaggeration of the exhibition's teeth. The exhibition also begins production by hiding in the dark perimeter of the Branch Arena, waiting for the opportune time to pounce. The exhibition often gains the upper hand if they are allowed to weave in and out of the shadows. If it is brought into the light, it is often easily committed by a tag-team effort of the Host and their primary Adjunct.</p>
                <hr class="dashed"/>
                <h2>Branch History</h2>
                <p>Below is the patient's recorded Branch history, listed in reverse chronological order. Patient has experienced Branches not logged below, as they were not seeking treatment at the time and were self-managing.</p>

                    <ul>
                      <li>Phases: Initiation, Staging, Production</li>
                      <li>Duration: ~00:05:00C, ~00:30:00M</li>
                      <li>Extensions:
                        <ul>
                          <li><strong>Host:</strong> Emory Torres (patch: baseball bat)</li>
                          <li><strong>Primary Adjunct:</strong> Rami Hakim (patch: dual handaxes)</li>
                          <li><strong>Secondary Adjunct:</strong> Danny Su&aacute;rez (patch: pocket knife)</li>
                        </ul>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Initiation consisted of an argument between the Host and Danny Su&aacute;rez, a friend of roughly ten years. Both claim arguments are not uncommon between the two. The exact details of the argument are unknown, but the primary Adjunct&mdash;Rami Hakim&mdash;claims that what he understands was said would not be enough to trigger a Branch. Both the Host and the attending Vice Management Specialist have agreed to label the Branch as rogue.</p>
                    <p>Exact staging times are unknown. Primary Adjunct was not present at Branch initiation and thus missed staging. Secondary Adjunct claims staging was relatively uneventful, mostly a dark void, which aligns with previous staging experiences.</p>
                    <p>The beginning of production followed the established Branch Formula, in that the extensions were placed inside the garage, and the exhibition lurked in the shadows. While the Host was looking for the exhibition, it attacked and injured the secondary Adjunct. The secondary Adjunct was able to injure the exhibition with his newly-established patch, and the Host began their attack. The Host remarks a lowered efficacy in their patch, of which the primary Adjunct attributes to excessive use outside of the Branch Arena. The primary Adjunct forced his way in with the use of a Backdoor and was able to commit the Branch with the help of the Host in a timely manner.</p>
