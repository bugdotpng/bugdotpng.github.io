    <h1>Hello World</h1>
    <p>I'm Bug! I'm a UX developer in the higher ed sector, and since I clearly don't get enough facetime with code and web stuff, I thought it would be fun to start a little github site where I can link smaller projects, etc. I also might turn this into a portfolio someday but for now it's gonna be a dumping ground. Neato.</p>
    <p>Anyway, standby for updates, etc. I'm just setting styles right now. None of the nav links work yet because I haven't thought about what I even want on here lol and I wanted to style the nav supes quick. Footer links work, tho!</p>
    <p>Hey! <a href="manual/index.html">Here's a link to a current WIP!</a> I haven't done much on mobile yet so beware lol</p>
    <h2>Interests</h2>
    <p>Here's some interests because I wanna style lists. And I love listing things.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Drawing, digital art, character design, etc.</li>
        <li>Writing and world-building</li>
        <li>Pottery and ceramics</li>
        <li>Plants - my favorites are spider plants, rubber trees, and ivies.</li>
        <li>Cats. Like...my cat and every other cat on this planet. *insert 'I just think they're neat' meme here.*</li>
        <li>Design, typography, print, etc. I may be in web now, but I got my bachelor's in graphic design and that was where I started my career, so I still love me some neat printing techniques and printed collateral.</li>
        <li>Stickers, pins, and patches. I think this should count as an interest. Tiny designs and trinkets make brain go BRRRRR</li>
        <li>Rocks, gems, crystals, etc. also make brain go brrrrr. I don't know anything about them, but I like to collect them. A lady at a rock booth told me I must've been an incredibly grounded person because I had an armful of quartz and amethyst. I am the furthest thing from a grounded person, and I just thought it was funny.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Pokemon</h3>
    <p>Yes, there's an entire mini-section dedicated to Pokemon. I can't help it. The Pokemon Company has me, personally, in a chokehold, and I'm going to make that everyone's problem.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Favorite Pokemon: Wooper, Sneasel, and Flygon. I could probably list at least 20 more without even thinking.</li>
        <li>Favorite games: Fire Red and Emerald (I'm clearly biased. I grew up with these games and they mean a lot to me!) I also like Black, Sword, and Legends: Arceus.</li>
        <li>Favorite Youtubers: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@FlygonHG">FlygonHG</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@CybertronVGC">CybertronVGC</a>. I don't do competitive battling, but I LOVE watching it! And FlygonHG is so fun to watch for nuzlocking ideas.</li>
        <li>Favorite card: I'm not a hardcore collector by any means, but I've managed to hold on to some neat cards over the years (including a first edition <a href="https://www.serebii.net/card/neorevelation/065.shtml">Shining Gyarados</a>!). But this particular <a href="https://www.serebii.net/card/aquapolis/015.shtml">Houndoom card</a> means a lot to me, and I love it dearly! I have it in Japanese and didn't even know Houndoom's name until I encountered it in the Fire Red post-game! So my friend and I grew up calling it "devil-dog" lol. I honestly love all cards from the eCard era. That particular card layout is so nostalgic!</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Anyways</h2>
    <p>I had no intention of that section getting to be that long, but here we are. Anyway, this is probably going to be this entire site for a while, at least until I can move some smaller projects over here and figure out what all I want to link.</p>
    <p>I genuinely don't know why I typed this all out. Blank HTML file make brain go BRRR I guess.</p>
