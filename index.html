        <h1>Hello World</h1>
        <p>I'm Bug! I'm a UX developer in the higher ed sector, and since I clearly don't get enough facetime with code and web stuff, I thought it would be fun to start a little github site where I can link smaller projects. I might turn this into a portfolio someday, but for now it's gonna be a dumping ground of stuff I'm working on. All my current projects are about the Vice Versa extended cinematic universe. Someday I'll include other projects, but I'm determined to finish these first! So for now, it's all Vice Versa.</p>

                <h3>Vice Versa</h3>
                <p>Danny just wants to live a normal life, but in a world infested with the parasitic creatures known as Vices, this is far from a simple thing to achieve&mdash;especially when he has one of his own. With the help of his good friends Gen and Rami, he has learned how to keep things under control, but the growing uneasiness has been getting harder to ignore. And when the raging spitfire Emory becomes a more sustained force in his life, he can feel himself on the verge of a breakdown.</p>

                <h3>Center for Vice Research and Support</h3>
                <p>Explore the inner workings of CVRS, the services they offer, and how they're structured and learn about all things Vices with the Vice Research Compendium. While this is not required reading prior to Vice Versa, this comprehensive overview of Vices can help readers better understand the mechanics of the world it takes place in. Future updates will include personalized patient and agent portals with in-depth logs of their interactions with the CVRS system.</p>

                <h3>Emory's Super Awesome Website</h3>
                <p>Emory is really committed to their vigilante efforts, so much so that they took their coding knowledge from their myspace days to make their own website! This is a good glimpse into their psyche and a great way to get to know Emory as a character.</p>
