                    <p>The longer a patient lives with their Vice, the more familiar they may become with its Branch Policy. If conditions are skewing toward a potential Branch and the patient feels unprepared, they can self-admit to Urgent Care for Activity Monitoring. After a brief questionnaire administered by an Intake Coordinator, the patient will be admitted to the intake bay, where a Traffic Coordinator will monitor them for signs of a Branch.</p>
                    <h2>What to Expect</h2>
                    <p>Once admitted, the patient will be placed in a bed in the intake bay. In order to maintain a comprehensive view of the patient’s status, they will be hooked up to a vitals monitor. Blood pressure, heart rate, oxygen saturation, and body temperature will all be monitored and let out an alert if any either fall below safe levels or change drastically.</p>
                    <p>Patients will have access to a call button that will alert their Traffic Coordinator if they feel any physiological or emotional changes not reflected on the monitors. Due to the elevated activity levels of the Urgent Care intake bay, a Traffic Coordinator may not be by one’s side throughout the entirety of their stay. Though, they will always have a view of their patients’ vitals and will never be too far out of reach.</p>
                    <p>If a Branch is initiated, the Traffic Coordinator will alert the Floor Manager, who will quickly build the proper team according to the Vice’s threat level. Traffic Coordinators do not aid in addressing Branches, aside from suspension in an emergency. For immature Alpha Vices, a Branch Coordinator may address the Branch alone, while an adolescent Epsilon Vice may call for a Branch Administrator, Solutions Architect, and multiple Branch Coordinators. Being honest in the initial questionnaire is imperative to receiving the proper treatment.</p>
                    <h2>Branch Options</h2>
                    <p>In the event of a Branch, an Urgent Care team is prepared to dedicate the resources to committing the Branch. Rescission is possible, if appropriate, but it is not typically the goal of the Urgent Care team. If the team sees the opportunity to do so, they will rescind the Branch; otherwise, they will work to commit the Branch.</p>
                    <p>Suspension in the intake bay is highly unlikely and is only performed if the necessary resources are not currently available, particularly in the case of an occupied Floor Manager or the understaffing of Branch Administrators. If a Branch is suspended, the patient will remain in the intake bay under monitoring until the proper resources can be gathered, then <a href="./branch-remediation.html">Branch Remediation</a> will be facilitated.</p>
                    <p>In the rare case of a Floor Manager underestimating a Vice’s threat after they have been admitted to the Branch Domain, Branch Coordinators or Branch Administrators may force Branch entry using a Bypass. Floor Managers themselves may also force entry, if understaffed.</p>
                    <p>After the Branch is committed, the patient will be discharged and referred to Primary Care for followup treatment.</p>

                                    <p>The duration of the stay will depend on the answers to the introductory questionnaire and the properties of the Vice. Extended attention is typically given to patients who haven’t had a Branch in over a week, have a Vice with a high threat level, or have exacerbated blights. Monitoring sessions can last anywhere from an hour to a full day.</p>

                        <p>Traffic Coordinators are the glue that holds the Urgent Care intake bay together by performing physicals, monitoring patient statuses, and facilitating treatment assigned by the Floor Manager on staff. These agents are meticulous and detail-oriented and work alongside Floor Managers as their right-hand agents to help organize and facilitate the flow of incoming patients.</p>
