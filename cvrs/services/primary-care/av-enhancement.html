                    <p><a href="../../about/our-team/primary-care.html#av-specialist">AV Specialists</a> are multifaceted agents who are capable of facilitating customized treatment options to address our patients’ needs. When referred from a Vice Management Administrator, the treatment type will be pre-determined, but if the patient feels that they need support elsewhere, the regimen can be adjusted.</p>
                    <h2>Types of Therapy</h2>
                    <p>AV enhancement therapy is typically administered to patients who have persistent blights and a low level of natural AV. Our bodies naturally produce AV as a defense mechanism against the VG that regularly floods our systems. Low AV output can result in an elevated VG level, which leads to agitated blights and weakens the immune system over time. Learn more about AV in <a href="../../vrc/bodies/av-patches.html">AV and Patches</a>.</p>
                    <p>General AV enhancement therapy focuses on elevating a patient’s overall AV levels. A subset of this therapy is patch support, wherein an AV Specialist focuses explicitly on bolstering the patient’s patch, rather than general, full-body support. Additionally, Branch recovery therapy helps patients who have recently committed a Branch, but are struggling with prolonged symptoms that should have been resolved shortly after the Branch was terminated, such as inexplicable fatigue and agitated blights. And finally, Patch establishment guides the patient through the process of establishing a patch.</p>
                    <h3>General AV Enhancement Therapy</h3>
                    <p>The crux of AV enhancement therapy is prolonged agent-to-patient contact, wherein the agent uses a pair of Summoning Gloves to transmit a steady flow of AV that is received by the patient. AV enhancement therapy is not typically a single-session remedy, and this therapy can take anywhere from a couple sessions to a year of consistent care. These sessions may require trial and error, especially the initial session. Every patient’s body is unique, and different areas have differing levels of receptivity. Patch summoning sites tend to be the most receptive, while contact with the neck, sternum, spine, and temples are common alternatives.</p>
                    <p>As opposed to patch support therapies, general AV enhancement targets the patient’s full body, using the summoning site to distribute the AV to the rest of the body. The degree at which AV is emitted for the patient to accept is generally quite large compared to other therapies. The patch summoning site is often overwhelmed with the degree of AV and passes it along to the rest of the body. With enough force, an AV Specialist can “push” the last bits of AV past the summoning site so as to not affect the patch, though some agents may tie in patch support therapy to their sessions, if needed.</p>
                    <p>Because AV is provided to the main flow that is already established, rather than being injected into the patient’s entire system, the risk of <a href="../../vrc/branches/fringe.html#instigation">instigating</a> Branches is quite low compared to other AV-focused treatments, such as <a href="./blight-management.html#av-shots">AV Shots</a>. However, treatment provided too quickly in succession has a higher risk of instigating Branches. At the beginning of treatment, an AV Specialist will present a designated treatment schedule that acknowledges this risk and times sessions accordingly.</p>
                    <p>Consent is an incredibly important part of AV enhancement therapy, and if at any time the patient feels uncomfortable, adjustments to the treatment plan can be implemented. Our agents will never require a patient to partake in a session or treatment they do not feel comfortable doing. Failure to complete therapy is not the end of treatment, and a Vice Management Administrator is likely to pursue other avenues for treatment, such as <a href="./blight-management.html">blight management</a>.</p>
                    <h3>Patch Support</h3>
                    <p>When infected with a Vice, our bodies produce a weapon-shaped collection of AV&mdash;called a patch&mdash;that can be summoned inside or outside of the Branch Domain to defend against an advancing Vice. Inside of the Branch Domain is the preferred and recommended environment for wielding a patch. When a patch is wielded outside of the Branch Domain, it can still be used, but it will be significantly less effective and take increased damage as a result of its weak bonds between the AV that would otherwise be solidified in the Branch Domain.</p>
                    <p>Even so, patches can still become damaged in the Branch Domain after repeated use or retaliation from the exhibition. Our bodies naturally replenish the AV between Branches, but some patients are unable to keep up, and their patch has become less effective as a result. Adolescent Vices in particular are impulsive and aggressive, so they tend to initiate multiple Branches in this life stage, which can make it difficult to maintain one’s patch. Additionally, some patients simply have a lower AV output.</p>
                    <p>Through repeated sessions, an AV Specialist can provide a steady flow of AV by making contact with the patient’s summoning site. Most patients with a patch have their summoning site in the palm of their hands, as this is where the body naturally produces the patch. Some patients choose to migrate their summoning site for convenience both inside and outside of the Branch Domain.</p>
                    <p>Patch support is typically a meditative session that lasts roughly 15 minutes. The AV Specialist places their hands on the patient’s summoning site and emits a steady flow of AV that is accepted by the patient. Dense pockets of AV lie directly under the skin of the summoning site, but these pockets can lose density with repeated patch use. When a patient summons their patch, these pockets release the AV in a pre-determined pattern that exits through the skin and materializes into the patch. In the Branch Domain, or even during staging, patches lose AV when they come into contact with VG, and when this AV is returned to these pockets below the summoning site, their levels are often much lower after prolonged combat. By targeting these pockets and elevating their AV levels, AV Specialists can replenish their reserves and bolster patches for future Branches.</p>
                    <p>Initial sessions may take more time for the patient’s body to be receptive of treatment. If a patient and AV Specialist are having difficulty connecting, the patient may be referred to a new AV Specialist. While patch support therapy is focused on replenishing and revitalizing an overused patch, AV Specialists can also perform patch calibration, wherein an agent is able to influence the design and makeup of a patient’s patch to better fare against their exhibition.</p>
                    <h3>Branch Recovery</h3>
                    <p>Even when they’re committed, Branches can take a toll on our bodies. Branch recovery therapy is administered to patients who have had a Branch committed in the last two weeks and have experienced inexplicable fatigue and agitated blights for more than three consecutive days. Suspended patients will not be accepted, and instead referred to Urgent Care to perform Branch remediation.</p>
                    <p>After strenuous or drawn-out Branches, a patient’s AV output can be affected. Especially during more rigorous Branches, our bodies are in overdrive, attempting to flood our systems with AV to defend against the advancing Vice. This often depletes a patient’s AV reserves, a finite collection of AV that may struggle to replenish after a longer Branch.</p>
                    <p>Because of the lower AV output, some Vices will continue to pursue augmentation and germination, even after a Branch has been committed, which can also negatively affect a patient’s immune system and result in agitated blights, moderate pain around the core, and debilitating levels of fatigue.</p>
                    <p>This therapy tends to have a more condensed timeline compared to general AV enhancement therapy. Because the AV Specialist is concerned with raising the patient’s AV levels before the next Branch, treatment sessions are often back-to-back and last no longer than a week. The actual execution of the therapy session is similar to standard AV enhancement therapy, with the primary distinction being the treatment timeline and a lower AV transmission so as to not trip the Vice’s defense system. When performing Branch recovery, AV Specialists must be prepared for rogue Branches, as the repeated sessions have a higher risk to cause instigation.</p>
                    <h3>Patch Establishment</h3>
                    <p>Establishing a patch is a process that can take anywhere from a few days to multiple weeks, depending on the body’s general AV output. Lower levels of AV take longer to complete establishment, which can also put a drain on the patient’s system, as energy is sometimes redirected to aid in creating the patch.</p>
                    <p>When a patch is first being established, the body is learning to maintain and control its production and flow of AV. Many patients report seasonal allergy-like symptoms during this time, often succumbing to fits of sneezing and coughing as the AV swells through their system. Eventually the body learns to channel AV to the palms, resulting in unpredictable, staticky bursts of AV. And finally, the body condenses the AV into a weapon-like object, specially designed to counter the Vice. AV Specialists are available to coach the patient through every step of patch establishment.</p>
                    <p>If a patient is having trouble establishing their patch efficiently, this therapy can help speed up the process and reduce the strain on the patient’s system. Like other AV enhancement therapies, patch establishment entails an AV Specialist making contact with the patient’s summoning site, typically aided by a pair of Summoning Gloves. A steady, contained flow of AV absorbed at the summoning site can attract the wandering AV to progress through the establishment process. Patch establishment can be completed in a single session, though it is not uncommon for patients to need multiple sessions. A patient is discharged once the patch has been fully established.

                        <p>AV Specialists are primarily concerned with a Host’s production of AV and facilitate AV enhancement therapy where patients are provided support for patch establishment, contracting and restoration, as well as general AV output. Vice Management Administrators typically refer patients to an AV Specialist if a more holistic Vice management approach is required in the event of Vices with a higher threat level.</p>
