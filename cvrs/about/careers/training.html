                        <p>Agents are required to complete different degrees of training depending on their role in order to be onboarded.

                        </div>
                        <p>Discover the roles and responsibilities of the many agents that make up the CVRS family. Whether they’re patient-focused or conducting research, our agents are passionate about making a difference.</p>

                </div>
                <div class="main-content">
                    <h2>Training Tiers</h2>
                    <p>Each training builds on the previous tier, meaning if an agent is expected to pass Suspension Training, they must first pass Vice Fundamentals and Branch Fundamentals. The duration of time displayed next to the training tier indicates the comprehensive time the training takes to complete, including its previous tiers. For example, Vice Fundamentals is a 4-month course, so the additional information learned in Branch Fundamentals is a roughly 2-month course, resulting in a total of 6 months to complete Branch Fundamentals.</p>
                    <p>The training tiers are as follows:<br><strong>Vice Fundamentals → Branch Fundamentals → Suspension → Commit → Rescission</strong></p>
                    <h3 class="has-label">Vice Fundamentals <span class="label">4 Months</span></h3>
                    <p>Vice Fundamentals gives a high-level overview of Vice anatomy, physiology, and psychology, ensuring agents have a firm foundation in Vice fundamentals. During this time, agents learn about the properties of Branches and common Branch Policies and practice decision-making skills in a high-stress environment.</p>
                    <p>Because Vice Fundamentals is the foundation of all other trainings, all agents, in a sense, must complete this training, as the information learned in this course will guide agents no matter their role, whether that’s face-to-face with patients or behind the scenes with research. Some roles, typically administrative or those that don’t interact with patients directly, only require that this training tier be passed. Any agents past this tier are likely to interact directly with patients.</p>
                    <p>In order to complete Vice Fundamentals, agents must pass a written exam. The following agent roles must pass Vice Fundamentals:</p>
                    <ul class="two-col">
                        <li>Record Proctor</li>
                        <li>Forecast Specialist</li>
                        <li>Lead Station Aggregator</li>
                        <li>Sector Advocate</li>
                        <li>Report Coordinator</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h3 class="has-label">Branch Fundamentals <span class="label">6 Months</span></h3>
                    <p>A direct extension of Vice Fundamentals, Branch Fundamentals expands to train agents who will be regularly brought in as pseudo Adjuncts or need to have a thorough understanding of Branch mechanics in order to perform their role. Agents will practice entering Branches and study the mechanics of Branch initiation.</p>
                    <p>In addition to passing the initial written exam at 6 months, agents must then pass a subsequent oral exam. The following agent roles must pass Branch Fundamentals:</p>
                    <ul class="two-col">
                        <li>Solutions Architect</li>
                        <li>Branch Proctor</li>
                        <li>Intake Coordinator</li>
                        <li>Research Proctor</li>
                        <li>Exposure Analyst</li>
                        <li>Vice Analyst</li>
                        <li>Branch Analyst</li>
                        <li>Behavioral Analyst</li>
                        <li>Product Engineer</li>
                        <li>Textile Engineer</li>
                        <li>Technician</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h3 class="has-label">Suspension Training <span class="label">1 Year</span></h3>
                    <p>Because these agents are expected to make regular direct contact with patients, agents practice speed and efficiency in making decisions under pressure and learn to recognize the warning signs of Branches. Suspension is the act of terminating a Branch during staging, granting the patient more time to gather the resources needed to properly address the Branch.</p>
                    <p>Many of these agents are likely to be around high-risk patients during their career, and learning to recognize a Branch being staged ensures the safety of the patient and those around them.</p>
                    <p>The agent must successfully suspend a Branch in order to receive certification, in addition to passing the written and oral exams of the previous training levels. The following agent roles must pass Suspension Training:</p>
                    <ul class="two-col">
                        <li>Branch Recovery Specialist</li>
                        <li>Blight Specialist</li>
                        <li>AV Specialist</li>
                        <li>Traffic Coordinator</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h3 class="has-label">Commit Training <span class="label">18 Months</span></h3>
                    <p>At the beginning of Commit Training, agents are brought in to Branches as pseudo Adjuncts to observe real-life cases addressed by professionals. During this time, agents learn efficient patch-summoning and wielding techniques, practice decision-making during high-stakes situations, and learn to find patterns in a Vice’s <a href="../../vrc/branches/policies.html">Branch Policy</a>.</p>
                    <p>After an agent demonstrates understanding as a pseudo Adjunct, they will be regularly brought in as a secondary Adjunct for patient Branches alongside a primary Adjunct, typically a Vice Management Administrator or Branch Administrator. Commit Training is considerably more rigorous compared to Suspension Training, as agents are expected to familiarize themselves with both the local and master research databases, while also learning the Branch Policies of their patients. In addition to the Branch admission practice in Suspension Training, agents will also learn to use a <a href="./gear.html#bypass">Bypass</a> to force entry into an active Branch.</p>
                    <p>Agents must successfully commit a Branch as a secondary or primary Adjunct in order to receive certification, in addition to passing the written and oral exams of the previous training levels. The following agent roles must pass Commit Training:</p>
                    <ul class="two-col">
                        <li>Target Hunter</li>
                        <li>Vice Management Coordinator</li>
                        <li>Floor Manager</li>
                        <li>Branch Coordinator</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h3 class="has-label">Rescission Training <span class="label">2 Years</span></h3>
                    <p>The most rigorous of the Branch training, Rescission Training requires agents to routinely commit Branches by shadowing Vice Management Administrators and Branch Administrators currently working with patients. Agents at this level should also be comfortable committing Branches by themselves and will be expected to do so by training completion. Most agents with this degree of training do not suspend Branches unless a commit would threaten the safety of the patient.</p>
                    <p>Agents must adhere to a rigid training schedule that ensures efficient patch wielding and decision-making in the Branch Domain. <a href="../../services/primary-care/patch-calibration.html">Patch calibration</a> services offered by Primary Care are also available if an agent’s patch is in need of optimizing. By the end of training, many agents are primary Adjuncts for patients.</p>
                    <p>An agent must successfully rescind a Vice as a secondary or primary Adjunct and pass the written and oral exams of the previous training levels in order to become certified. If an agent is unable to rescind a Vice in the time allotted&mdash;either due to personal failure or lack of patients requiring rescission&mdash;they are enrolled in a new round of Rescission Training, which spans roughly 6 months. The following agent roles must pass Rescission Training:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Branch Administrator</li>
                        <li>Vice Management Administrator</li>
                    </ul>
                    <div class="alert mt-xl mb-xl">
                        <span class="alert__heading">Failure to Pass</span>
                        <p>Failure to complete the designated training during the allotted time will result in probation where the agent will have another chance to complete their training. If an agent is still unable to complete their training, they will be terminated and can re-apply after six months.</p>
                    </div>
                    <h2>Continuing Education</h2>
                    <p>After an agent has passed their respective training tier, they will be expected to stay up to date with research findings, learn any cutting-edge technology that has been introduced to their gear kit, and keep their skills sharp. CVRS will conduct regular on-the-job trainings to ensure agents continue to meet their position requirements.</p>
                    <h3 class="has-label">Role Refresher <span class="label">Bi-Annual</span></h3>
                    <p>Mandatory Role Refreshers are held twice a year, one in January and the other in July. No matter the role, these trainings are mandatory. Role Refreshers typically span one week, each day dedicated to a different team. Depending on the team, Role Refreshers can be structured like a conference or as hands-on demonstrations. Research teams typically use this time to present new findings, while Public Health & Safety teams cover role expectations and address any common concerns among individual teams.</p>
                    <h3 class="has-label">New Tech Training <span class="label">As-Needed</span></h3>
                    <p>CVRS is always introducing new technology to our agents’ <a href="./gear.html">gear kits</a>. As existing technology gets upgrades or completely new technology is introduced, we are committed to ensuring our agents understand how to efficiently and expertly wield this technology to best serve our patients.</p>
                    <h3 class="has-label">Research Enhancements <span class="label">As-Needed</span></h3>
                    <p>As the field of vicology expands and Vices continue to evolve, our research team is dedicated to facilitating up-to-date research to unravel the mysteries of Vices. As the research team makes new discoveries, the Research Proctor will present this information in a day-long or half-day seminar based on the complexity of the findings. Minor and patch updates to the VRC typically take a half-day, while major updates require the full day.</p>
                    <p>Agents unable to attend will be able to review recordings of the seminar and have access to the VRC changelog. Updates to the VRC will be made at the time of the presentation.</p>
