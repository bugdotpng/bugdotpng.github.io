                    <p>In their early stages, Theta Vices are relatively nonthreatening. In fact, many of them are initially misclassified as Alphas due to their sudden advent and straightforward Branch Policy. Their threat mainly lies in their potential explosive Branches--called Super Branches--with the only indication being a sustained dormancy period of excessive feeding beforehand. If their attempt at dispersion is suspended or committed, they are likely to try again after their resources have been replenished.</p>
                    <p>In between dispersion attempts, Theta Branches are generally simple, though their exhibitions can prove to be more difficult than the average Alpha exhibition. While they are primarily offensive, they tend to attack in short bursts, coming in close to deal damage, then quickly backing away before one can react. Ranged and thrown patches work well against Theta exhibitions.</p>
                    <p>Theta Vices use Branches primarily as a way to gauge a Host’s abilities. Their staging radius remains relatively average during this time. While most Branches can be easily addressed, their Super Branches are often initiated during times of stress or illness. They also extend their staging radius to increase the number of potential tertiary Adjuncts. Because these Super Branches rely on queuing multiple tertiary Adjuncts, Thetas tend to have lean, but extensive networks. Before these Branches, multiple stolons are released to queue potential Adjuncts.</p>

                        <h3>Larval</h3>
                    </div>
                    <p>Larval Theta Vices are often mistaken for Alphas, leading to incorrect classifications and a false sense of security. While Thetas are not particularly active during the larval stage, it is imperative to begin learning its Branch Policy as soon as possible so as to avoid surprises in the adolescent stage. A Theta will not initiate a Super Branch during the larval stage. It simply does not possess the energy to do so.</p>
                    <p>The Branches that larval Thetas initiate tend to be relatively easy to predict, as the narrow pool of properties present at advent provide a short list of potential triggers. The Branch triggered at advent will be the blueprint of most Branches initiated during this stage, down to its Branch Domain and the exhibitions presentation and attack strategy.</p>
                    <p>Theta exhibitions tend to be quite frail but can hit hard, often referred to as the “glass canons” of the Vice world; though, in the larval stage, their offensive power has yet to be established. Most larval Theta exhibitions can be addressed quite easily. Theta Branch Domains are similar to those of Alphas and are generally simple, especially in this stage.</p>
                    <h4>Rescission Guidance</h4>
                    <p>Unlike Alpha Vices, Theta exhibitions are quite frail, no matter their life stage. Even in the larval stage, their exhibition can be quite easy to address, if one can manage to catch it. Though they are young and inexperienced, larval Theta exhibitions can still move quickly and avoid attacks with impressive reflexes. Ranged patches can allow extensions to continue attacking, even after the exhibition has backed away. They are easily caught and overwhelmed by a seasoned CVRS agent, such as a Vice Management Administrator. Vice Management Coordinators are often trained on larval Theta exhibitions, as they require quick thinking and precision, but ultimately pose no threat if the Branch is simply committed.</p>

                        <span class="superhead">Stage 2</span>
                        <h3>Adolescent</h3>
                    </div>
                    <p>The true threat of Theta Vices begins to reveal itself in adolescence. Branches become more common, almost exponentially, as the Vice aims to establish its network. Adolescent Thetas make exceptional germination progress during Branches, and their networks often appear quite faint on a VGMS compared to other classifications’. Their network is much less complicated than a Zeta’s, for example, but it becomes established throughout the body much quicker. It appears faint on VGMS because it is less dense, but the groundwork for future expansion has been laid.</p>
                    <p>Adolescent Thetas are regarded as one of the most impulsive, least discerning classifications. They initiate Branches often with seemingly no foresight. If a situation passes QAC, an adolescent Theta is likely to initiate a Branch. This predictability tends to lure Hosts into a false sense of security, and after a series of consecutive, mundane Branches, it will enter a period of dormancy, where it feeds and stores energy to inevitably initiate a Super Branch.</p>
                    <p>The period of dormancy leading to a Super Branch can be almost palpable, many Hosts complaining of inexplicable fatigue and brain fog. Thetas use their extensive network to ensnare passing hormones all throughout the body, and during this excessive feeding, this can lead to hormonal fluctuations. If you notice these symptoms, contact your Vice Management Administrator immediately, as a Super Branch is imminent.</p>
                    <p>Super Branches are not any more complex than standard Branches; though, they do tend to be classified as “rogue” so as to intentionally catch the Host off guard. Their “super” modifier primarily alludes to the expanded staging radius. Where the average Vice’s staging radius is roughly 12 feet, a Theta’s is a whopping 36 feet, greatly increasing the scope of potential tertiary Adjuncts. What’s more, Thetas use their multiple stolons to detect when the Host has entered a high-traffic area, such as a concert or bus.</p>
                    <p>While the staging radius may be wider, the actual time spent in staging is quite short compared to other classifications. This is primarily to reduce the amount of time potential tertiary Adjuncts have to break free, but this also reduces the time available for secondary or primary Adjuncts to join. Once the Branch enters production, it becomes more difficult to snap out of the trance induced by being queued, though it is often quite manageable.</p>
                    <p>Knowing tertiary Adjuncts are likely to self-dismiss, Thetas are indiscriminate in their queuing process, adding everyone in the staging radius. This, of course, proves to be quite a risky endeavor. Most tertiary Adjuncts self-dismiss, but there is always the possibility of admitting someone who has an intimidating patch or heightened combat skills. If this proves to be the case, the Adjunct will be dismissed, which requires considerable effort and can backfire, distracting the Vice during combat.</p>
                    <p>Due to its shorter staging time, Super Branch Domains remain quite simple, though a Theta’s exhibition is typically wild and disorienting upon entry. Thetas use the addition of tertiary Adjuncts to distract its Host and increase its reach if dispersion is achieved. But the threats of a Super Branch stop there. Otherwise, in the Branch Domain, a Super Branch can be addressed as one would a standard Branch.</p>
                    <h4>Rescission Guidance</h4>
                    <p>Rescinding an adolescent Theta Branch is just as straightforward as doing so in the larval stage. Super Branches prove slightly more intimidating with their deviation from the Branch Policy, short staging, and the addition of tertiary Adjuncts. Most standard Branches can be addressed with the proper patch, and Super Branches can be prepared for if one is aware of their condition. At the first sign of dormancy, often manifesting as inexplicable fatigue, contact your Vice Management Administrator to begin preparing for the Super Branch.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="timeline__stop">
                    <div class="heading-group">
                        <span class="superhead">Stage 3</span>
                        <h3>Mature</h3>
                    </div>
                    <p>Mature Theta Vices are not all that different from adolescents. Maturity is mostly observed through their slight increase in discernment--though it isn’t much--and any slight enhancements to the exhibition or Branch Domain, but these properties of the Branch Policy are typically not prioritized.</p>
                    <p>While Thetas somewhat wrangle their impulses in maturity, they are still regarded as one of the most impulsive and active classifications. If anything, mature Vices are often easier to handle than their adolescent counterparts, considering there is a lot less Branch activity, allowing time for the Host to better prepare between Branches.</p>
                    <h4>Rescission Guidance</h4>
                    <p>There are not many differences between rescinding adolescent and mature Theta Vices. As with any Vice, caution is always recommended, and building a proper care team can ensure a successful rescission. A Vice Management Administrator is likely equipped to perform rescission alone, though some may enlist a Branch Coordinator for backup.</p>

                    <!-- BRANCH POLICY -->
                    <h2>Branch Policy Properties</h2>
                    <p>Like Alpha Vices, Theta Branch Policies are relatively straightforward; though, because of their Super Branches, Thetas are known for occasionally initiating rogue Branches. Paying close attention to Vice behavior between Branches can help a Host prepare in advance for any potential Super Branches. The properties explored below are generalizations and are not guaranteed to apply to every Theta Vice.</p>
                    <dl class="desc-list">
                        <dt>Environmental Branch Triggers(s)</dt>
                        <dd>Due to their sudden advent, this pool of triggers tends to be quite small. Especially in adolescence, Thetas are indiscriminate in their preferences, and pull from any and all properties present in advent. Super Branches, however, are typically rogue, deviating from the established property.</dd>
                        <dt>Branch Domain Blueprint</dt>
                        <dd>Theta Branch Domains tend to be simple and small, with a few established areas where the exhibition can briefly retreat and avoid combat, such as behind shelves, doors, or desks. Theta Branch Domains often closely mimic the environment present at advent.</dd>
                        <dt>Exhibition Presentation</dt>
                        <dd>Theta exhibitions are the glass canons of the exhibition world, typically with sharp features and thin, limber bodies. Exhibitions tend to be aerodynamic and smooth, with few protrusions like horns, tails, and wings. Because of this, Hosts often report drape blights in common junction areas like the shoulders, neck, and elbows.</dd>
                        <dt>Exhibition Attack Strategy</dt>
                        <dd>In the Branch Domain, exhibitions prefer close combat, coming in near the host to deal damage, then fleeing to safety before the Host can retaliate. It doesn’t stay hidden for long, and will often come out of hiding on its own to initiate another attack. This cycle is repeated ad nauseum, with the Vice hoping to wear the Host down. </dd>
                        <dt>Core Priorities</dt>
                        <dd>Thetas prioritize their Super Branches, which hinge on queuing as many tertiary Adjuncts as possible during their short staging period. In order to accomplish this, a Theta Vice needs a large, limber network, which it achieves by performing explosive germination during regular, repeated Branches.</dd>
                    </dl>
                    <h2 class="mt-xl">Proposed Care Team</h2>
                    <p>While all Vices are different, the proposed care team below can give a general idea of the skills and equipment needed to properly address a Theta Vice.</p>
                    <dl class="desc-list">
