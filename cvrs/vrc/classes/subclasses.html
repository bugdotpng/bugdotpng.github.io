                <div class="main-content" id="main-content">
                    <p>Subclasses are a fairly new facet of Vice research, primarily contributed to and conducted by <a href="../../about/our-team/observation.html#behavioral-analysts">Behavioral Analysts</a>. Subclasses are denoted with a leading double-hyphen and are always lowercase (e.g. Epsilon--gamma) and do not impact threat levels, though some can be unique to specific threat levels. Subclasses can also be stacked, for example: Epsilon--gamma--sigma.</p>
                    <p>The current subclasses are <a href="#gamma">--gamma</a>, <a href="#omicron">--omicron</a>, <a href="#sigma">--sigma</a>, and <a href="#rho">--rho</a>.</p>
                    <h2 id="gamma">--gamma</h2>
                    <p>This relatively rare subclass is applied to Vices that exhibit a level of intelligence that far surpasses the intelligence of even mature Vices with a high threat level. While all Vices are thought to display some level of sentience, --gamma Vices interact with their Hosts in ways that suggest an advanced understanding of not only the self, but of their Hosts as well. Quantifying these behaviors has proven relatively difficult, though some common examples are an ability to communicate with the Host, either by using words, understanding thoughts, or sharing sensations, and a subjectivity in initiating Branches.</p>
                    <p>These unique behaviors--and how they differ from similar behaviors in other Vices--are outlined to the best of our current understanding below.</p>
                    <h3>Communication</h3>
                    <p>Speech manifests differently among individual --gamma Vices, and even varies in complexity between the different realms, with the highest mastery typically manifesting in the <a href="../branches/phases.html#metaphysical">Branch Domain</a>. Some Vices have difficulty forming complete sentences, others have expansive vocabularies, and some have even held full, complex conversations with the Host and their Adjuncts. In the Branch Domain, Vices use their exhibition as the vessel through which they project their speech. Voices are about as varied as exhibitions, though their accents tend to mimic Hosts’, with greater variation in their pitch, talking speed, and quirks. Maturity tends to affect this ability as well, with most larval Vices struggling to communicate. As the Vice matures and observes its Host for longer, communication seems to come somewhat easier.</p>
                    <p>Outside of the Branch Domain, however, communication is much less straightforward and objective. Literal words are not said, as a Vice has no means of vocalization; rather, communication tends to take the form of sharing sensations. They’re not necessarily complete sentences, but they do convey feelings and ideas in a relatively abstract way, directed straight to the Host’s brain. In return, Vices seem to be able to “understand” the Host’s thoughts, often responding with novel sensations in return. Some Hosts have reported a foreign sense of guilt emanating from their core when they discuss rescission techniques with their Vice Management Administrator, almost as if the Vice is pleading for its life. Some Vices have even expressed attachment to or affection for the Host.</p>
                    <p>One may think the ability to communicate with their Vice would swing things in the Host’s favor, but this often introduces another avenue for the Vice to take advantage of its Host. Within the Branch Domain, many --gamma Vices use their speech capabilities to manipulate, confuse, or lie to the Host to gain the upper hand, either in the current Branch or future Branches. The introduction of foreign emotions outside of the Branch Domain can also affect a Host’s decision-making and muddy details in pursuing treatment.</p>
                    <h3>Branch Instigation Subjectivity</h3>
                    <p>Most Branches can be prepared for by studying a Vice’s <a href="../branches/policies.html">Branch Policy</a>. An important facet is understanding the environmental triggers that result in Branch initiation, typically established at and pulled from the Vice’s advent. In the larval stage, Branches are not initiated often, but in adolescence, most Vices initiate Branches when any external conditions meet the environment triggers of their Branch Policy. As Vices mature, they begin to exhibit restraint and are able to “assess” the environment to make more informed decisions about Branch initiation.</p>
                    <p>Where --gamma Vices are set apart lies in their ability to perform this assessment through a subjective lens. This indicates an understanding that surpasses a Vice’s typical abilities of “logging” environmental properties and weighing them against each other in a mathematical formula; instead, --gamma Vices are able to pick up on differing tones&mdash;even going so far as being able to pinpoint passive aggression or sarcasm&mdash;and can assess the situation through the Host’s point of view based on internal, personal, and even unrecognized emotions. Some --gamma Vices have even suggested a Branch initiation subjectivity based on supposed emotions, sometimes conveyed to the Host through sensations, as explored above.</p>
                    <p>Rather than weighing the conditions in an established, static numerical system, as most Vices do, --gamma Vices introduce an unpredictability to their Branch initiations, making their Branch Policy extremely difficult to understand. This ability makes it near impossible to bait or trigger Branches into being initiated.</p>
                    <p>While intelligence and observational skills can make other Vices difficult to deal with, ultimately with enough resources, we are able to learn why they take certain actions, as it all boils down to instinct and a drive to procreate or survive. When subjectivity and emotions are introduced into the mix, it becomes much more difficult to draw conclusions and make hypotheses about how a Vice can be expected to behave, making --gamma Vices incredibly difficult to address.</p>
                    <h3>Addressing --gamma Vices</h3>
                    <p>--gamma Vices are quite difficult to handle, as it almost feels impossible to escape their watchful, calculating eye. Many Hosts report the constant, unnerving feeling of being watched, and --gamma Vices always seem prepared for any new strategies the Host discussed with their <a href="../../about/our-team/primary-care.html#vma">Vice Management Administrator</a>. Catching a --gamma Vice by surprise is near impossible, and it’s not fully understood what all these Vices are able to observe.</p>
                    <p>Many Vice Management Administrators address these Vices by instigating a Branch without an explicit plan and enlisting the help of multiple <a href="../../about/our-team/primary-care.html#solutions-architect">Solutions Architects</a> to help concoct a plan once the Branch moves into production. When a Vice seems to be prepared for everything, sometimes the best plan is not having one at all.</p>
                    <h2 id="omicron">--omicron</h2>
                    <p>--omicron Vices are capable of camouflaging their <a href="../biology/energy.html#network">network</a>. These Vices have evolved to emit a dense, neutralizing particle that coats both their core and the tracks of their network and prevents them from being seen, even with <a href="../../about/careers/gear.html#parsing-goggles">Parsing Goggles</a>. This technique is implemented as a way to lure Hosts into a false sense of security by keeping their network activity hidden. In some instances, this ability has also prevented accurate classification.</p>
                    <p>It is believed that this subclass of Vices evolved specifically to camouflage the stolon and prevent the detection of an established rumen. Non--omicron rumen are easily detected using Parsing Goggles to track the path of the stolon from the Host to the rumen. Without the ability to see the network, this path is not visible.</p>
                    <p>--omicron Vices tend to “turn off” this camouflaging mechanism prior to Branch initiation. This allows those outside of the Branch to observe and document the network. This mechanism will resume after the Branch has been addressed. Research suggests this camouflaging process does impose a drain on the Vice’s resources. Because of this, the “intensity” of the cloaking tends to fluctuate based on environmental readings from the Vice’s network and the Vice’s activity, particularly in the case of an initiated Branch. As larvae, --omicron Vices typically stay cloaked, and as they mature, they tend to prioritize other processes, leading to inhibited camouflaging capabilities. Simply speaking, this cloaking mechanism is a spectrum, and it is not always maxed out.</p>
                    <p>Regular visits with a <a href="../../about/our-team/primary-care.html#vma">Vice Management Administrator</a> or <a href="../../about/our-team/primary-care.html#record-proctor">Record Proctor</a> can help track the Vice’s progress based on other characteristics and symptoms. Many Vice Management Administrators will purposefully initiate a Branch after collecting the proper resources in an attempt to force the Vice to lower its cloaking abilities.</p>
                    <p>Our <a href="../../about/our-team/manufacturing.html">Manufacturing team</a> is currently working on a new type of lens for Parsing Goggles to address this issue. While this technique can throw less experienced Hosts for a loop, it should be known that the core should always be visible with Parsing Goggles and a VGMS, and once the network becomes established in adolescence, though it will be faint, it will always be visible through those channels as well. A complete inability to see one's core is a dead giveaway that the Vice has --omicron capabilities.</p>
                    <h2 id="sigma">--sigma</h2>
                    <p>--sigma Vices have wider diet preferences, most commonly observed in, but not unique to, <a href="../classes/zeta.html">Zeta Vices</a>. Where other Vices feed on hormones, --sigma Vices are much more permissive and feed on other bodily substances such as plasma or synovial fluid in addition to hormones. --sigma Vices typically have a <a href="../biology/advent.html#gradual">gradual advent</a>, are more likely to reach maturity, and are known for more complex <a href="../branches/policies.html">Branch Policies</a>.</p>
                    <p>A --sigma palate is much less particular, and they can shift their primary energy source depending on resource availability. They are much more adaptable and resilient in times of scarcity, where other Vices may need to sacrifice growth. --sigma cores are often larger than others, though they do tend to be less structurally sound and are more susceptible to damage from AV or attacks in the Branch Domain. Despite their permissive palate, Vices biologically benefit best from the consumption of hormones, so if a --sigma Vice doesn’t keep a varied diet that also includes hormones, its form can be compromised.</p>
                    <p>Due to the elevated feeding habits of most larval Vices, many with a --sigma subclass are actually initially discovered by health professionals outside of CVRS. Because their feeding is not confined to hormones, --sigma Vices often result in adverse medical effects and can be initially detected using medical imaging or blood tests.</p>
                    <h2 id="rho">--rho</h2>
                    <p>While most Vices have a single, stationary core, --rho Vices have multiple, smaller cores throughout the Host’s body connected by an extremely dense network that often presents as stiff joints. This subclass typically accompanies Vices of a higher threat level and are often stacked with the --gamma subclass. Vices with established networks often receive this subclass, such as <a href="../classes/zeta.html">Zeta</a> and <a href="../classes/epsilon.html">Epsilon</a> Vices.</p>
                    <p>--rho Vices start out with a single core that houses and processes information. As they mature, they create more cores in a process not dissimilar to advent, wherein the VG coursing throughout the body colonizes a benign mass. Cores created post-advent act like rumina until the main core is threatened, either by a patch in the Branch Domain or by manual intervention with an AV Shot. Even after sustaining damage, the core is able to send the bulk of its information&mdash;including its Branch Policy and other data&mdash;to a different core using the network. This process is near-instantaneous, taking no more than a few seconds to send the information from head to toe. All Vice cores will need to be destroyed in order for the Vice to be properly rescinded.</p>
