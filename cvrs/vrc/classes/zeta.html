                        <p>A Zeta core has a unique epithelium that attracts hormones from throughout the body, acting as a lightning rod that allows them to feed consistently through all life stages. Because of this, Hosts with Zeta Vices tend to display extreme, visible signs of fatigue. These Vices have advanced storage capacity and are able to hoard more resources than the average Vice, in addition to having a penchant for establishing rumina. If allowed to mature, Zeta Vices can be extremely difficult to address due to their established, often numerous energy reserves.</p>

                    <p>A Zeta core’s unique biology is key to its elevated feeding efficiency. While most larval cores feed passively, larval Zeta cores are the only classification to actively attract hormones from throughout the body. Additionally, Zeta networks seem to suggest a more efficient “capture” system with specialized tracks; though, this has proven difficult to study in a controlled setting, as networks are difficult to observe up close and Zeta Vices are generally rare. Even after establishing a network in adolescence, Zeta cores continue to attract hormones, allowing them to catch any stray hormones that manage to escape. In short, Zeta Vices have evolved to feed.</p>
                    <p>Despite the biological differences, Zeta cores do not appear any differently on a VGMS and cannot aid in early classification. Due to the current limitations of imaging, a VGMS is not able to suggest three-dimensional differences outside of denser objects appearing more opaque. Because the epithelium surrounds the entire core, it appears the same as others.</p>
                    <p>Zetas are, instead, often detected because of their immense strain on the Host’s endocrine system. Many Hosts initially seek treatment from an endocrinologist and are subsequently referred to our Primary Care agents. While Zetas do not completely inhibit hormone absorption, they prevent roughly 60% of excreted hormones from reaching their intended destination. Many Hosts present symptoms found in those that have hypothyroidism. It is recommended to not supplement with medications that will increase the body’s output, as this will only work to further fuel the Vice’s growth. After rescission, many Hosts return to normal.</p>
                    <p>Where other Vices may threaten with increased intelligence, the threat behind a Zeta lies in its ability to withstand attacks in the Branch Domain. Using their excessive storage, Zetas can reroute resources to bolster their exhibition or even repair it. While Delta and Epsilon Vices prey on frustration and aversion, Zetas are often approachable at the start of production. Their intimidating stature and immense defensive capabilities, even in the larval stage, cannot be understated. These exhibitions do not have much in the way of offensive features, but they don’t need them. Branch times can quickly become lethal if the proper resources are not available.</p>

                        <h3>Larval</h3>
                    </div>
                    <p>Like most Vices, larval Zetas are relatively docile. While they do not avoid Branches altogether like Epsilons do, they don’t go out of their way to initiate them, either. Larval Zetas are generally nonreactive and focused primarily on feeding. Zeta larvae are likely to only initiate Branches in direct response to threat; otherwise, they lay low.</p>
                    <p>Contrary to popular belief, Zeta cores are smaller than Epsilon cores and closer in size to Beta, and even Alpha. Exhibition size has no bearing on core size; rather, the core shrinks and grows as the amount of information it stores decreases and increases respectfully. Due to their simple Branch Policy, Zeta cores are not terribly dense and do not get very big.</p>
                    <p>Most larval Vices come with fatigue, especially early on, but the fatigue that results from larval Zeta Vices is unmatched. Many Hosts report a full-body, aching fatigue that prevents them from participating in their normal activities. In addition to their honed feeding capabilities, Zeta Vices also tend to have the <a href="./subclasses.html#sigma">--sigma subclass</a>, meaning their diet is varied and indiscriminate, some going so far as to consume non-hormonal substances like plasma and synovial fluid. Larval Zeta Vices in particular are the least picky, with their palate narrowing as they age.</p>
                    <h4>Rescission Guidance</h4>
                    <p>Because exhibitions will only become more difficult as they age, it is highly recommended to rescind a Zeta Vice during the larval stage, if possible. Their exhibitions are still defensive, but have not had the opportunity to enhance their makeup between multiple Branches. Because they do not yet have a network, larval Zeta exhibitions cannot heal themselves, making this life stage the perfect time to attempt rescission. Larval Zeta exhibitions can, in theory, be rescinded alone, but multiple Adjuncts are recommended so as to not let the Branch drag on longer than necessary.</p>

                    <div class="timeline__stop">
                    <div class="heading-group">
                        <span class="superhead">Stage 2</span>
                        <h3>Adolescent</h3>
                    </div>
                    <p>Adolescence is an interesting stage of heightened activity for Zeta Vices. The otherwise notoriously sluggish Vices increase Branch activity, using these Branches to establish their network and make explosive germination progress, a process it has otherwise neglected between Branches.</p>
                    <p>Zeta networks, even in adolescence, can become extremely complex after only a few Branches. Because of the sheer amount of progress made during production, any damage received as a result of a commit is likely not enough to fully undo the network’s progress. Because of this progress, and due to an established network, many Hosts begin to report excessive, chronic drape blights.</p>
                    <p>In adolescence, Zeta exhibitions tend to evolve the most intensely; though, they don’t necessarily change features between Branches. Rather, adolescent Zeta exhibitions enhance their defensive characteristics. For example, an exhibition with a thick hide may work to thicken it, or harden the scales that cover its body. Adolescent Zeta exhibitions can quickly become unmanageable if the appropriate patch is not available.</p>
                    <h4>Rescission Guidance</h4>
                    <p>While adolescent Zeta Vices are no more cunning than their larval counterparts, if one is not addressed in early adolescence, their exhibition can quickly evolve out of control where multiple Adjuncts are required for success. Because they have begun reinforcing their defensive characteristics, long-range piercing patches can help tear through the otherwise tough exterior. Vice Management Administrators are likely to enlist the help of a Branch Administrator to provide much-needed firepower. In the event of an inefficient patch, they may also refer a Host to an AV Specialist for Patch Coaching.</p>

                        <h3>Mature</h3>
                    </div>
                    <p>In maturity, Zeta Vices are the masters of defense and energy storage. Despite their simplicity, Branches at this stage can be deadly. The combination of a bulky exhibition, efficient feeding system, and potential “healing” powered by an external rumen can make Branches last for multiple, agonizing hours.</p>
                    <p>Mature Zetas pull back from their more aggressive adolescent tendencies and initiate Branches at a much slower rate. Between Branches, they mostly focus on energy storage, with many deigning to establish a rumen if conditions are appropriate. While most Hosts experience elevated levels of fatigue when infected with a Zeta Vice, it multiples considerably once a rumen is established. The never-ending flow of resources between the core and its rumen places an immense strain on the Host’s body, resulting in chronic joint pain, brain fog, and compromised immune responses. Learn more about rumina in <a href="#">Vice Biology: Feeding &amp; Energy Management</a>.</p>
                    <p>Mature Zeta exhibitions are intimidatingly large, with many standing as tall as 10 feet and intense bulk to boot. Depending on its maturity, upwards of ten Adjuncts may be required to deal with its exhibition in a timely manner.</p>
                    <h4>Rescission Guidance</h4>
                    <p>Rescinding a mature Zeta Vice is extremely difficult. It is impossible to do alone, no matter the strength of ones patch. The sheer density of the exhibitions defenses will wear down a patch before its able to make any meaningful progress. For this reason, we recommend pursuing rescission guided by a Vice Management Administrator. Many suggest a hybrid approach, combining Branch maintenance with regular AV shots to attack the network and inhibit rumen establishment. They may also refer the patient to meet with an AV Specialist for AV enhancement therapy to bolster a patient’s AV output and naturally undo germination progress made during a Branch. If possible, we recommend manually detaching a rumen before pursuing rescission to cut the Vice off from its primary energy reserve and inhibit exhibition healing. A Public Deployment Branch Administrator can provide this service if the location of the rumen is known and the Host is present.</p>

                    <!-- BRANCH POLICY -->
                    <h2>Branch Policy Properties</h2>
                    <p>Despite their gradual advent, Zeta Branch Policies are quite simple and easy to prepare for. Their policies have been described as “utilitarian” in that there are often no bells and whistles, complicated mind games, or complex designs. Their biggest threat lies in their seemingly indestructible exhibition and never-ending supply of energy. The properties explored below are generalizations and are not guaranteed to apply to every Zeta Vice.</p>
                    <dl class="desc-list">
                        <dt>Environmental Branch Triggers(s)</dt>
                        <dd>Most Vices with a gradual advent have a large, complex pool of experiences and triggers to pull from. Zeta Vices do not initiate Branches often, resembling the discernment observed in Epsilon Vices. Because of this, Zetas tend to have a relatively simple and straightforward pool of environment triggers and don’t seem to favor any properties in general. They do seem to choose highly-specific scenarios, however, such as specific phrases, sounds, and even emotions.</dd>
                        <dt>Branch Domain Blueprint</dt>
                        <dd>Zeta Branch Domains are unnervingly simple and straightforward, many reporting designs that mimic mundane, featureless environments like empty warehouses and backrooms. They are less concerned with the psychological mind games that many other classifications delight in playing, and instead pour the majority of their resources into exhibition presentation. A Zeta Branch Domain is relatively static throughout its life cycle, and does little in the way of evolving. Zetas tend to be quite utilitarian, and because Branch Domains are fundamentally the housing of a Branch, they don’t put much thought into the design outside of that.</dd>
                        <dt>Exhibition Presentation</dt>
                        <dd>Zeta exhibitions tend to have vague, blob-like exhibitions with no distinctive features like horns or claws. Fundamentally, exhibitions exist as a defensive layer around the core. While most have the secondary effect of inciting fear in the Host and their Adjuncts and can actively fight off core attacks, Zeta exhibitions are most concerned with the primary task at hand: protecting the core. Because of this, Zeta exhibitions often do not have limbs or other modes of ambulation, and tend to resemble slugs, snakes, and eels. Zeta exhibitions are often covered in protective scales or a thick hide, which manifest as drape blights that change the texture of the Host’s skin. Unlike other classifications, Zetas are able to “heal” their exhibitions by rerouting VG stored in established rumina. Zeta exhibitions are not indestructible, but after multiple iterations, previous weak spots are likely to be addressed and reinforced between Branches, which can quickly lead to a seemingly impenetrable exhibition. This can be avoided by rescinding in the larval stage or early adolescence.</dd>
                        <dt>Exhibition Attack Strategy</dt>
                        <dd>Simply put, Zeta exhibitions do not attack. As a defensive exhibition, they instead focus on mitigating and reducing damage. Zeta Branches are somewhat unconventional; they are low-energy and simple, almost intimidatingly so. Most Zeta Branches are predictable; its large, defensive exhibition sits patiently in the middle of its domain and braces for attack. Like Epsilon Vices, Zeta Vices aim to prolong Branch times, allowing sufficient time for augmentation. If its exhibition is severely damaged, it will likely reroute resources from its rumen if one has been established. This is particularly the case with mature Zetas.</dd>
                        <dt>Core Priorities</dt>
                        <dd>Throughout its life cycle, a Zeta Vice is primarily concerned with feeding and utilizing its energy to establish additional energy reserves, either by maximizing its network potential or by establishing a rumen. Outside of Branches, Zetas are focused on feeding and resource management, unlike most Vices that attempt to make germination and augmentation progress at an extremely slow pace; for this reason, Zeta Branches tend to be drawn out to provide the Vice with additional time to augment and germinate.</dd>

                    <h2 class="mt-xl">Proposed Care Team</h2>
                    <p>While all Vices are different, the proposed care team below can give a general idea of the skills and equipment needed to properly address a Zeta Vice.</p>
                    <dl class="desc-list">
                        <dt><a href="../../about/our-team/primary-care.html#VMA">Vice Management Administrator</a></dt>
                        <dd>These agents will construct a holistic, comprehensive understanding of the Vice and facilitate care accordingly. Vice Management Administrators are experts on your specific Vice’s behavior, meaning they can enlist the help of other agents where extra support may be needed.</dd>
                        <dt><a href="../../about/our-team/primary-care.html#branch-admin">Branch Administrator</a></dt>
                        <dd>These agents are master wielders of their patch and can bring much-needed firepower to addressing a Zeta Vice in an efficient and timely manner.</dd>
                        <dt><a href="../../about/our-team/primary-care.html#branch-coordinator">Branch Coordinator</a></dt>
                        <dd>Due to their bulk, Zeta exhibitions often require multiple Adjuncts to chip away at their outer defenses, with Branch Coordinators providing support for Branch Administrators.</dd>
                        <dt><a href="../../about/our-team-primary-care.html#av-specialist">AV Specialist</a></dt>
                        <dd>An accurate and efficient patch is key to addressing a Zeta Vice. In the event of a weak or unhelpful patch, an AV Specialist can provide Patch Coaching, wherein they work with the patient to influence the design and function of their patch. AV Specialists can also provide AV enhancement therapy to boost a patient’s AV output and tame any germination progress made during a Branch.</dd>
                        <dt><a href="../../about/our-team/primary-care.html#blight-specialist">Blight Specialist</a></dt>
                        <dd>Due to their extensive networks, Zeta Vices often trigger chronic blights, which can be addressed and relieved by a resident Blight Specialist, if severe. Blight Specialists are often on standby to monitor blights and provide insight into possible changes in Vice activity.</dd>
