                        <p>Vices have begun to evolve at an alarming rate. What used to be standalone behavioral deviations have recently contributed toward broader trends in behavioral changes, going so far as to introduce new classifications or alter our fundamental understanding of Vices as a whole. This repository outlines the behavioral and biological deviations that are actively being monitored by our Observation team.</p>

                    <p>A wild cottontail rabbit in rural Indiana is the first documented case of natural Vice infection in an animal. A local found what they thought was a sick or injured rabbit in their backyard and brought it to a wildlife vet for assessment. Upon examination, a Branch was initiated and the veterinarian was drawn into a Branch. No further details are available at this time.</p>

                        <h2>Self-Sufficient Detached Rumina</h2>
                        <span class="subhead">Probability: High</span>
                    </div>
                    <p>Vices that deign to establish a rumen do so in times of excess to hoard resources. Fundamentally, rumina are external deposits of energy that can be accessed during times of scarcity or in preparation for exponential growth. They are mostly stationary, non-sentient extensions of the Vice’s core. Rumina are generally rare and require elevated intelligence to execute successfully. However, due to increased Vice threat levels in recent years, rumina have become more common.</p>
                    <p>This particular anomaly was first documented roughly 14 months ago. What began as a single, isolated event, soon became a widespread, national phenomenon, with cases.</p>
                    <p><span class="superhead">Anomaly Overview</span>
                    Abandoned rumina across the nation have begun exhibiting novel, self-sufficient behaviors previously observed only in parent Vices. Typically, when a parent Vice detaches from its rumen--most commonly due to the Host straying out of range--it begins to deteriorate, letting out a steady stream of VG into the environment as it decays, unable to sustain itself without the constant flow of resources from the core.</p>
                    <p>These rumina not only avoid deterioration, but also display complex behaviors, such as ambulation in response to threats and utilizing stolons to feed on the hormones of passersby. It is currently unclear what drives them; they seem unable to initiate Branches and prioritize feeding over any other behaviors.</p>
                    <p><span class="superhead">Notable Observations</span>
                    The large majority of rumina that have exhibited this anomaly were originally created by a Zeta Vice, though these sentient rumina are considered distinct biological entities from the parent Vice, and may be distinct from Vices altogether, given they begin as colonized varmint flesh rather than benign human tumors.</p>
                    <p><span class="superhead">Current Obstacles</span>
                    Experts are currently debating whether or not this anomaly would result in a new subclass or an entirely new classification. Some experts even suggest this entity should be an entirely separate organism, considering its relationship with humans differs from the parasitic Vices.</p>
                    <p>Regardless of the verdict reached, this discovery has greatly altered our understanding of Vices and the circumstances surrounding their advent. We look forward to approaching and understanding Vices through this new lens.</p>

                        <h2>Pattern of Behavior Observed Across Multiple Classifications, Novel Subclass Possible</h2>
                        <span class="subhead">Probability: High</span>
                    </div>
                    <p><span class="superhead">Anomaly Overview</span>
                    Vices from multiple different classifications have begun intentionally initiating Branches in crowded areas while maintaining the established Branch Policy. Many have been documented as foregoing previously preferred initiation environments to preserve their energy and wait for the detection of a crowded area.</p>
                    <p><span class="superhead">Notable Observations</span>
                    Some Vices with higher intelligence--particularly Epsilon, Zeta, and mature Beta and Theta classifications--have begun displaying a preference for public Branch initiations. A notable characteristic of these individual Vices is a well-established network that has prioritized a collection of stolons that monitor environmental conditions. Some of these Vices also share a gradual advent after excessive exposure to public gatherings, such as after a business trip, conference, or music festival; though, this characteristic is less common and currently speculative.</p>
                    <p><span class="superhead">Anomaly Overview</span>
                    Because it spans across multiple classifications, a novel subclass is possible. However, this behavior was previously only observed in Theta Vices, meaning the qualifications for a Theta classification may need to be revisited if one of their notable behaviors has begun presenting in other classifications.</p>
                    <p>Many experts argue, however, that Theta Vices are known for their larger staging radius, not necessarily the discernment and detection of a crowded environment. Theta Vices are not particularly intelligent, and this behavior--crowded public initiations--suggests a level of intelligence not typically found in Thetas.</p>
                    <p>Experts are currently trying to agree on a verdict. If this behavior is widespread enough and has presented in enough separate classifications, a new subclass is likely.</p>

                        <h2>External Branch Domain and Mixing of Host Extension and Exhibition</h2>
                        <span class="subhead">Probability: Low</span>
                    </div>
                    <p>Historically, Branch Domains have existed exclusively in the metaphysical realm, with ties to the corporeal realm. Recently, a patient submitted a report to our Branch Analysts about experiencing the Branch Domain in the corporeal realm.</p>
                    <p>The patient, who is currently in high school, was hanging out with a friend after school when a Branch was initiated. The patient claims the Branch was not rogue in nature and was likely the result of the heavy conversation they were having with their friend. During staging, neither the Host nor the attempted Adjunct claimed to feel any of the trademark properties of staging, such as the magnetic pull of the staging radius. Additionally, the Adjunct was not admitted to the staging queue and remained conscious and aware next to the Host.</p>
                    <p>Once the Branch moved into production, the scenery did not change to mimic the regular Branch Domain, and the Host began transforming into the exhibition. The Branch was committed before the Host could finish transformation, as the impact from the Adjunct’s patch knocked the Host unconscious. After the Host regained consciousness and recovered from their Branch, another Branch was initiated under the guidance of a Vice Management Administrator, and no anomalies were detected. Branches have resumed their expected behavior and no additional anomalies have been reported at this time.</p>
                    <p>Until this anomaly becomes a more widespread issue or more instances are recorded, this case will remain backlogged. As of now, replication of this anomaly is considered unlikely.</p>

                        <h2>Shed-Induced Memory Loss Outside of Designated Core Extension Period in Delta Vices</h2>
                        <span class="subhead">Probability: Low</span>
                    </div>
                    <p>A few patients have claimed that after their Delta Vice shed its core extension, the resulting memory loss affected memories outside of the designated life of the shed core extension. This has proven extremely difficult to reproduce, as many of these accounts are hearsay and dependent on third parties providing information to the Hosts. Humans are forgetful creatures, even outside of Vice-induced circumstances. We have no way of proving that this alleged “memory loss” is an anomaly and not a product of external factors.</p>
                    <p><span class="superhead">Grounds for Reopening Case</span>
                    If the following conditions are met, the case can be reopened for investigation:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>More thorough, timestamped documentation of memory loss</li>
                        <li>Severity of memory loss is undeniable; e.g. a Host forgets the name of someone dear to them, not just an acquaintance</li>
                        <li>Anomaly has further reach and has been documented by enough stations to warrant upgrade to medium scope</li>
