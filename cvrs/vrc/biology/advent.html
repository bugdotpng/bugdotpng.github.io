                        <p>The advent of a Vice occurs in one of two ways: sudden or gradual. Sudden advents are triggered by a single event, while gradual advents occur over an extended period of time. Sudden advents tend to be more common in Vices with a lower threat level, while gradual advents often result in Vices with a higher threat level, though this is not always the case.</p>

                    <h2 id="sudden">Sudden Advent</h2>
                    <p>A sudden advent is triggered by an abrupt increase in hormone levels, typically due to an isolated traumatic event. This dramatic influx of hormones fuels the expedited creation of VG. The excessive spawning of these VG causes them to leak from the mass and flood the Host’s system, prompting the first Branch, known as the advent Branch. The complexity of this Branch depends on the <a href="../classes/index.html">Vice’s classification</a>. Most advent Branches are simple and straightforward, with a fragile exhibition and simple Branch Domain that is pulled from the current environment. Though Vices are able to use the continued hormone influx to fuel the Branch, most Vices prematurely terminate the Branch and retreat due to their lack of established energy reserves, resulting in an uncharacteristically short Branch. Though, in the case of a <a href="../classes/lambda.html">Lambda</a> advent, the advent Branch can be overwhelmingly complicated.</p>
                    <p>The properties observed during this advent Branch give valuable insight into preparing for future Branches&mdash;known collectively as the <a href="../branches/policies.html">Branch Policy</a>&mdash;as these properties tend to remain the same over time for the majority of classifications. Sudden advents provide relatively straightforward information that often helps in addressing future Branches or even avoiding them. Triggers are often pulled from the advent Branch, and the properties inside the Branch Domain, including its blueprint and the exhibition’s presentation and attack strategy, remain relatively the same through the Vice’s life cycle. Xi Vices, however, are able to enhance and optimize these properties between Branches.</p>
                    <p>The following classifications have sudden advents: <a href="../classes/alpha.html">Alpha</a>, <a href="../classes/theta.html">Theta</a>, <a href="../classes/lambda.html">Lambda</a>, <a href="../classes/xi.html">Xi</a>, and <a href="../classes/phi.html">Phi</a>. Sudden advents do not necessarily constitute a lower threat level, but instead suggest a more straightforward and predictable Branch Policy.</p>
                    <h3>Post-Advent Classification Process</h3>
                    <p>Sudden advents are unmistakable, and after a Host has experienced the advent Branch, they are advised to make an appointment with CVRS Primary Care. Upon admission by an Intake Coordinator, the Host will meet with a Record Proctor who will perform a VGDS to detect the presence of a core. Patients who receive a positive VGDS will be given a tentative, preliminary classification based on the information provided, which is subject to change. They will then be scheduled to meet with a Vice Management Administrator and establish treatment goals. Learn more about this process in <a href="../../services/primary-care/index.html">Services: Primary Care</a>.</p>
                    <h2 id="gradual">Gradual Advent</h2>
                    <p>Gradual advents occur when the mass is exposed to a steady increase in hormones over a period of time, rather than being tied to a point in time. A Vice with a gradual advent prioritizes thickening its epithelium, which later becomes the foundation for its core, as opposed to producing large quantities of VG in its early stages.</p>
                    <p>Because there is no single event to trigger an advent Branch, Vices with a gradual advent tend to have more complex Branch Policies, influenced by the variety of events experienced as the Vice is forming. This often leads to larger exhibitions, more complex Branch Domains, and broad or convoluted triggers.</p>
                    <p>Vices with a gradual advent are typically indicated by increased and uncharacteristic fatigue. The first Branch initiated by the Vice often takes the Host by surprise, and due to the early emphasis on epithelium enhancement, these Branches are often more difficult to address and have more general defenses compared to those with a sudden advent. These Vices are still immature, however, and will eventually run out of steam and terminate the Branch, but due to the extended Branch time, the Vice core is often allowed to expand more than that of a Vice with a sudden advent.</p>
                    <p>The following classifications have gradual advents: <a href="../classes/beta.html">Beta</a>, <a href="../classes/delta.html">Delta</a>, <a href="../classes/epsilon.html">Epsilon</a>, <a href="../classes/zeta.html">Zeta</a>, and <a href="../classes/omega.html">Omega</a>. The complex Branch Policy that results from a gradual advent helps to elevate the threat level of these classifications.</p>
                    <h3>Post-Advent Classification Process</h3>
                    <p>Because there is no advent Branch to verify the advent of a Vice, those who have a Vice with a gradual advent often have more difficulty initially being admitted. A Branch is required to pass admission, though a referral from an external medical professional, such as a General Practitioner, will suffice. Upon admission, the Host will meet with a Record Proctor who will perform a VGDS to detect the presence of a core. Patients who receive a positive VGDS will be given a tentative, preliminary classification based on the information provided, which is subject to change. They will then be scheduled to meet with a Vice Management Administrator and establish treatment goals.
