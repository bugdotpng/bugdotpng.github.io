                    <p>A Vice’s Branch Policy is comprised of the following properties, each further explained below:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Environmental Branch Trigger(s)</strong>: the environmental conditions that result in Branch initiation</li>
                        <li><strong>Branch Domain Blueprint</strong>: the layout of the Branch Domain</li>
                        <li><strong>Exhibition Presentation</strong>: the exhibition’s makeup and features</li>
                        <li><strong>Exhibition Attack Strategy</strong>: how the exhibition behaves in the Branch Domain</li>
                        <li><strong>Priorities</strong>: overall, which process the Vice devotes the most energy towards</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Contrary to popular belief, the time between Branches is not part of a Vice’s Branch Policy, and is instead influenced by the method used in addressing the Branch (suspension vs commit) and how much the core was damaged. Learn more about this relationship in Branch Options. Additionally, different classifications and Vices in different life stages can have varying preferences. For example, larval Epsilon Vices initiate almost no Branches at all, while adolescent Alpha Vices can initiate Branches as often as bi-weekly. Learn more about these expected behaviors in <a href="../classes/index.html">Classifying Vices</a>.</p>
                    <h2 id="triggers">Environmental Branch Trigger(s)</h2>
                    <p>This set of information is established at advent and is referenced during the Quality Assurance Check (QAC) before a Branch. If the current properties of the Host’s environment match at minimum three of the properties found at advent, the Vice will likely proceed with Branch initiation. Examples of these properties most commonly include sounds and smells, but can even include temperature and the amount of natural light. Because of their numeric, formula-like approach, these triggers can easily be prepared for and anticipated in certain conditions.</p>
                    <p>Epsilon Vices and other Vices with gradual advents, however, can have a broad pool of conditions to pull from, making it difficult to map this facet in early development. Additionally, the --omega subclass introduces a unique subjectivity into this decision-making process that can make it near impossible to parse.</p>
                    <p>Because larval Vices do not have the biological infrastructure to perform QACs, they instead assess internal conditions and are likely to initiate a Branch if the preferred hormone level exceeds a specific threshold.</p>
                    <p>Learn more about QACs and the conditions assessed in <a href="./phases.html#qac">Phase 0: Quality Assurance Check</a>.</p>
                    <h2 id="domain">Branch Domain Blueprint</h2>
                    <p>As discussed in <a href="./phases.html#metaphysical">The Metaphysical Realm (Branch Domain)</a>, the layout of the Branch Domain typically pulls inspiration from the environment around the Host at advent. Vices with a sudden advent typically result in smaller, compact domains that focus more on explicit details and the literal translation of environments. Small details can be difficult to parse when observed directly, much like attempting to recall the details of a dream. Gradual advents, on the other hand, result in larger, more complex domains that focus on the “feel” of the environment. This is typically an abstract concept, as many Hosts cannot relay the specific details that make them uneasy about the domain; rather, feelings gathered from the complex circumstances around advent are somehow imbued into the domain. These can differ between Hosts, but common feelings include urgency, dread, and overwhelm.</p>
                    <p>The overall blueprint of the Branch Domain stays roughly the same throughout a Vice’s life cycle, but can and often does increase in complexity as the Vice matures, especially for those with a gradual advent or a higher threat level. As they mature, some Vices with gradual advents will reveal additional “stages” to their Branch Domain, tied together by disorienting, escheresque transitions, such as <a href="../classes/epsilon.html">Epsilon Vices</a>, for example. <a href="../classes/delta.html">Delta Vices</a> are able to completely abandon these blueprints and start from scratch in a process known as shedding. Some classifications are capable of constructing completely novel blueprints during their life cycle to better adapt to threats, but this is only observed in the extremely intelligent <a href="../classes/omega.html">Omega classification</a>.</p>
                    <h2 id="exhibition">Exhibition Presentation</h2>
                    <p>Only present in the Branch Domain, a Vice's exhibition shields the vulnerable core from the Host, Adjuncts and their patches. Exhibitions typically take the form of predatory animals—though the possibilities are endless. Some exhibitions are comprised of the properties present at advent, typically textures, smells or sounds and can even draw from the innate fears of the Host. The characteristics of the exhibition are also influenced by its attack strategy, and vice versa, an example being how defensive exhibitions typically have a thicker skin or protective outer shell.</p>
                    <p>Exhibitions are incredibly unique and vary greatly between Hosts, but tend to stay roughly the same throughout a Vice’s life cycle. As with the Branch Domain blueprint, a Vice’s exhibition can increase in complexity as the Vice matures. Exhibitions can be classified by size, and tend to stay in the same size grouping, even as complexity increases. Epsilon Vices often shroud characteristics of their exhibition presentation to later reveal as a trump card, Deltas can completely scrap and create new exhibitions as a result of shedding, and the intelligent Omega Vices are able to change exhibition characteristics, even during an active Branch. Learn more about exhibitions in <a href="./exhibitions.html">Exploring Exhibitions</a> or explore the different exhibition characteristics between classifications in <a href="../classes/index.html">Classifying Vices</a>.</p>
                    <h2 id="strategy">Exhibition Attack Strategy</h2>
                    <p>This data set is relatively broad and refers to a Vice’s M.O., that is, how the Vice interacts with the Host and Adjuncts within the Branch Domain. This attack strategy informs how the exhibition is classified, as offensive, defensive, hasty, or balanced. A Vice’s attack strategy is not directly tied to its classification, though most classes tend to see higher concentrations of specific exhibition attack strategies. For example, <a href="../classes/theta.html">Theta Vices</a> typically have hasty exhibitions while <a href="../classes/zeta.html">Zeta Vices</a> almost exclusively have defensive exhibitions.</p>
                    <p>Attack strategy also refers to the literal plan of attack once the Branch moves into production. This data is extremely broad, as every exhibition is different, but includes preferences such as which extensions the exhibition targets and how the exhibition interacts with the Branch Domain--if it uses objects or hides behind them. Learn more about exhibitions in <a href="./exhibitions.html">Exploring Exhibitions</a> or explore the different exhibition characteristics between classifications in <a href="../classes/index.html">Classifying Vices</a>.</p>
                    <h2 id="priorities">Priorities</h2>
                    <p>This facet refers to what process(es) a Vice prioritizes during active Branches and even between Branches. Vices are capable of multitasking, though doing so often sacrifices efficiency and performance in multiple areas. Because of this, when presented with the decision of what to pursue, Vices typically have a preference. Much like the exhibition attack strategy, this is not necessarily tied to a Vice’s classification, though it is influenced heavily.</p>
                    <p>For example, most <a href="../classes/alpha.html">Alpha Vices</a> pursue augmentation, but <a href="../classes/beta.html">Beta Vices</a> prefer germination. Not all Vices choose between germination and augmentation, however. <a href="../classes/delta.html">Delta Vices</a> direct their energy toward shedding, and <a href="../classes/zeta.html">Zeta Vices</a> use theirs to establish rumina.</p>
                    <p>This priority does not imply that a Vice will only use their energy to perform shedding or germination; rather, what this facet implies is a Vice’s dedication to a given process. All Vices must perform germination and augmentation as they mature, but overall, a Vice that prioritizes germination will have a much more established and complex network compared to those that prioritize augmentation. Learn more about these priorities and what they imply for each classification in <a href="../classes/index.html">Classifying Vices</a>.</p>
