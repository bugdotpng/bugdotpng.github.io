                <h2>Unscheduled Suspension</h2>
                <span class="price">FREE</span>
                <p>If I see you in staging out in public and you don’t have any help, I’ll take the initiative and suspend the Branch so you can get some extra time to find help. And I’ll do that for free! When I drop your body off at CVRS they’ll give me a stipend, so don’t worry about trying to tip me! (a stipend is about $40 in case you’re curious)</p>

                <h2>Scheduled Suspension</h2>
                <span class="price">$75</span>
                <p>If you know you’re probably gonna have a Branch happening soon and you don’t wanna commit it, we can meet in the alley behind the corner store whenever you want, and we can chainsmoke or eat hot chips until it happens. I won’t charge you if nothing ends up happening. I appreciate the company. I can bring a few joints and some hot chips, but it'd be nice if you brought one or two joints of your own. I’ll even take some of those shitty gummies. Don’t worry about the hot chips tho. I know a guy.</p>

                <h2>Observation</h2>
                <span class="price">$150</span>
                <p>If you’re not sure about your vice status, I can follow you around for a day and monitor your behaviors, read some vibes, and see what’s going on. I need about 6 hours minimum to get an accurate reading and at the end of the day I’ll give you my analysis. DISCLAIMER!!! I’m not psychic so I can’t be responsible if I end up being wrong. I’ll try my best tho! No refunds.</p>

                <h2>Suspension Shadowing</h2>
                <span class="price">$75</span>
                <p>If you’re just curious about what I do, you’re welcome to tag along with me for a day as I do my rounds. I’ll probably give you some tips along the way, but if you want more in depth stuff, you gotta get the next package. I wouldn’t mind doing these for free but I gotta charge for them since I'm sorta putting myself at risk of being caught by an agent in disguise. You understand.</p>

                <h2>Suspension Training</h2>
                <span class="price">$300*</span>
                <p>If you wanna learn how to suspend Branches like I do, I can take a day or two to teach you some cool tricks for summoning and wielding patches. So obviously you can only do this if you have your own patch. I’ll even track down some neat gear for you. This one’s a bit more expensive because I don’t want people doing this unless they’re real serious about it. Plus, it saturates the market so that’s why I take a commission, too. But hey, that’s the price of learning from the best!<br/><small>* daily plus 5% suspended Branch commission</small></p>

                <h2>Gear Bundle</h2>
                <span class="price">$50</span>
                <p>If you’re already pretty good at suspensions but you’re looking for some gear, I can get some for you. Imma make you sign a <a href="./waiver.html">waiver</a> tho, because sometimes the gear doesn’t come from the most uhhhh sanitary places. I do try to clean them pretty good but I'm not a miracle worker. And sometimes I have to mess with the wiring to get them to work good, but I’m not an electrician either. Don’t worry tho, I’m usually very thorough!</p>
